                    Today’s demonstration will be a little lab exercise that you can set up to practice using my backdoor script that can be found on my github page. THIS LAB WILL REQUIRE YOU TO WATCH AND FOLLOW TWO VIDEOS AND GUIDES STEP BY STEP TO PULL IT OFF!         
                </br>
                </br>                                                                   
                                                                    
                    YOU WILL NEED A SEPARATE SYSTEM TO FULLY SIMULATE THE TEST (OR VM IF YOU PREFER)                                                        
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    The VM setup is going to be done on kali nethunter BUT, the instructions for this carry over to ANY system that you want to test against the backdoor server on
                                                                
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    I recommend checking out my video guide on how to setup kali nethunter in case you want to do the lab this way! It’s FUN and you get to apply Mobile hacking like a PRO.                      
        
                </br>
                </br>
        
                    The goal of the exercise is to show you how to: setup the backdoor exploit, experimenting with kali nethunter (if you happen to have it setup), show you how to set up an apache2 server to deliver payloads, crack passwords with John the ripper so that you can pop the SSH service on the main system, and then show you how to exploit the system further.

                    WE ARE GOING TO RUN A SIMPLE PING SWEEP VIA THE MAIN COMPROMISED SYSTEM TO PULL IT OFF, GOING UNDETECTED!!

                    Due to the nature of how I want you to experience a “limited” shell which you’ll often run into, you’ll notice I’ve made it a bit “less interactive” to a degree so that you HAVE to get into the habit of finding ways to upgrade the quality of your reverse shell to a system!

                    Today’s lab will be the more hands on part of how to setup your first arduino project HANDS on.

                    Like I’ve mentioned before, this is basically the “hello world” for arduino. Things will get A LOT more interesting once you cover the core basics so you can start building your own hacking tools with it!

                    For today’s video, I will be going over how to write the beginner source code that you need to create your very own LED light bulb in conjunction with a switch module using Arduino. This is basically the “hello world” for Arduino. Step by step instructions should you need to read them over can be found below in the main video!        
                </br>
                </br>                                                                   
                                                                    
                    This is going to be a 3 part process, where each step I want you to play around with the core basics of what I’m showing you so you understand what I’m doing and how everything works.                                     
        
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    The first part is this one, writing the main code and learning how to read the basic diagram chart for the Arduino UNO board. This is to get you into the habit of learning how to program any module first which is the first and hardest step. Step 2 will be us putting it all together so that you get a live visual on how to set it up. Step 3 will be me showing you around the Arduino IDE, so that you know how to configure boards and various libraries for it. Much like the python one, this first project of ours will be on easy mode, and progressively get harder as time goes on. THERE IS AN END GAME TO THIS!         
                
                </br>
                </br>  
                
                    THIS REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE AN ARDUINO UNO BOARD.  
        
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    The main reason why this is going to be a 3 step process is because you will be learning stuff about software engineering as well, and I don’t want to overwhelm you with too much information at a time! That, and I want you to play around with all the stuff that is covered in the main video each time and ask me questions so that you MASTER it by the time the next video launches.

                    Don’t focus on memorizing the code step by step, that will get you nowhere. Focus on UNDERSTANDING the theory and the science behind that I’m doing.

                    Today, I'm going to talk more about ransomware attacks and how to prevent them. This is to raise more awareness on proper Cyber Security data Hygiene methods, as well as other techniques that can be used to prevent any real damage should this attack connect. This article is also going to feature some of my formal QA answers from a recent interview I did most recently.

                    I recently participated in a formal QA interview for a research group at the University of Washington that focused on Business Impact Analysis, and the best mitigation strategies and tactics that should be applied to better secure our digital landscape. The goal of the research project is to help educate small businesses run by women and other minority groups on proper Cyber Security practices. The QA was led by a woman named Grace Sommers. If you would like all the full in depth answers regarding the QA, you can find it on my patreon attached to the advanced version of this article. It's 9 pages and you can learn a lot about how to properly defend your digital systems from various attack vectors, including various endpoint security methods if that fancies you.

                    This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!

                    Ransomware attacks are on the rise, and are a favorable attack method commonly used by a lot of crypto gangs. It's important to know how to protect yourself from these types of attacks. Ransomware, as shocking as this might sound, is EASY to stop, rather, easy to render useless. It's simply a matter of understanding the critical flaw within the attack method itself and what it relies on to execute.

                    I'll also be covering some basic stuff like FDE, cryptography, etc, so that you FULLY understand how the attack method works. Pay close attention to the cryptography stuff since you NEED to understand how it works, both from the perspective of a threat actor, as well as from an overall security standpoint perspective.

                    If you would like a demonstration of the technique, I wrote an article demonstrating how to write the code and perform the technique, as well as a live demonstration that can be found on my YouTube channel. If you would like to see the sample code for it, you can find it in my "Python-Pen-Testing-Tools" in my main Github Repository

                    Today I want to talk about two different types of file inclusion techniques that can be used to exploit web applications: Remote File Inclusion and local file inclusion. I also want to talk about the difference between the two since they tend to be mistaken for one another, as well as a few techniques that can be used to mitigate against them.

                    Today's article will include a video demonstration of how to perform local file inclusion, also known as directory traversal, against a remote web application server. I'll even cover one of the best FREE beginner tools that you can use to apply the technique in a more automated fashion.

                    If you’ve been watching most of my videos, even some of my meterpreter stuff so far, you’ll notice that when I’m delivering payloads on a local network I LOVE to host an apache2 server that will serve payloads to victim systems on the network. It bypasses any blacklists from the main ISP and default gateway since this is an internal HTTP server and it’s not morally set to block those. 
        
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    BUT, what if you don’t have the means to setup an apache2 server? This is where you get crafty and make one yourself. It comes in handy for a lot of practical applications that allow you to mix it up with past techniques I’ve shown you, and apply stuff that even apache2 and nginx servers aren’t designed to do. Be mindful, I'm not saying you should drop the apache2 setup. It’s a staple and go to tool overall in general whether it be for penetration testing, or simply just web application development to test your site for responsiveness and effects.

                    Today’s Arduino lesson I’m going to show you how to program a potentiometer.

                    The goal of this project is to get you prepared on how to handle analog input for any module in arduino so you can work with stuff like: dials, radio modules, and even joystick input.

                    PAY CLOSE ATTENTION to this project as what you’ll learn here, on top of the other stuff will carry over to what is to come soon and a lot more. These projects will start off easy, but like I said, WILL, get progressively harder and more interesting.

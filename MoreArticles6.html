                    Today, I’m going to cover how to program an RF module with arduino in order to send radio waves from one radio module to another. 
        
        
                </br> 
                </br>                                                                   
                                                                    
                    This is going to come majorly into play for the next lab that I have set, as well as one of the biggest projects in the long run, so do pay close attention to how I am writing the code for it.
        
        
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    Don’t forget that how to set up any and all modules takes place during the major lab that will be combining all the parts together. 
        
             
                </br>
                </br>  
        
                    The goal for all of this is to get you used to how to write the code, and then we dive into how to physically set all of it up which is the fun hands on part that you all know and love.

						<p>I’m also going to talk a bit about the various creative ways threat actors can exploit an access point to do some serious damage and a lot more. Of course whistles I’m just theorizing. It’s not like I’ve been paid to do this stuff before right haha…. cricket noises.. AHEM… back to the point of the matter!</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I’m also going to talk about what SPOF is since it’s a CRITICAL topic that you’ll often come across in Cyber and Information security, WHICH YOU NEED TO KNOW. It’s so important that simply not knowing it is one of the MAIN reasons why we have so many security breaches and bad Cyber Security practices. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Lastly, since this is of course the danger series, I am going to address MANY remedies that can be done in order to enhance your overall network security, most of which you probably have never thought of in the first place.  I’ve played around with a lot of this stuff, so do take my word for it. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p>

                        </h4>

						<p>WAP, which stands for wireless access points, are the various gateway networking devices that we use to access various local networks including the internet: routers, hubs, switches, etc. They host various endpoint devices: laptops, desktops, mobile devices, CCTV systems, that are able to communicate with each other on the network via various networking protocols like TCP/IP for example, allowing them to exchange various data packets in order to communicate. Think of WAP’s, in the case of this article, like your “house”, where you are trying to “protect” it. You still following me? Good!</p>

</br></br>
                        <h4 id = "spof" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is SPOF 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>SPOF, which stands for Single Point of Failure is when one endpoint or vulnerability leads to a SIGNIFICANT compromise of a multitude of systems in an infrastructure(s). </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>For example, the common element of a human factor via phishing and social engineering. It doesn't matter how many security factors you have at play, if even ONE person screws up and lets the threat actor in, then it is all for naught, hence it is a SPOF.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Let’s try another factor, but this time a bit more technical. Let’s say you happen to have multiple endpoints with application systems on them facing each other, many of which have access to each other's resources, even the most critical ones. In the event should ONE of these systems, or even if it were a singular system that was connected to everything in the same manner, it would lead to a MASSIVE SPOF that could do some heavy damage to the infrastructure. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, let’s dive into the main dangers that could happen should a your WAP happen to be compromised. </p>

                        <h4 id = "hackers" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Your WAP aid’s hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Anonymity is one of the biggest assets for a threat actor. It allows them to go undetected and remain untraced. There are NUMEROUS ways to go about this: burner phones, burner laptops, tor, FREE wifi spots, etc, BUT, did you know that YOUR AP(Access Point) can be used as a means to allow threat actors to keep their anonymity. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Now this doesn’t sound too bad right? Someone wants to use your wifi without your consent, not a big deal! WRONG! It becomes a HUGE deal when what they are doing is being traced back to YOUR location and IP address. Even if you are innocent, if the odds are law enforcement tracks back malicious activity to your IP address you suddenly are thrown under the bus by something you didn’t do. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Everything I’m saying is a COMMON tactic that hackers use to stay off the radar. If you use someone elses WIFI, it even let’s you do the one thing threat actors should NEVER do, which is hack from the comfort of your own home.</p>

                        </h4>

						<p>Recently with the development of OpenAI, which lead to stuff like ChatGPT, we’ve entered a more advanced era of A.I., where it can do a bit more than just “Hey Siri”, or “Hey Alexa”, and query and search stuff for us and return the results. “A.I” has progressed to the point where it’s able to do ACTUAL stuff like: generate images for us, write our resume and cover letters, generate basic code templates, generate animations, etc. I think you get the picture! BUT, don’t be misled by what you see on paper. Not everything translates well. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>The main overall goal of A.I., which stands for “Artificial intelligence”, as I’ve mentioned, is to serves to overall be a replication of human intelligence. That’s the goal of computing technology overall, as we’ve quite LITERALLY tricked an actual rock into THINKING… AND IT WORKED. Computing technology is supposed to be an extension as well as amplification of the human intellect and capabilities. So far we have computers that are able to follow instructions and perform tasks with 100 percent accuracy and proficiency at incomprehensible speeds…. just as long as it’s been programmed to do so CORRECTLY of course. The big downside of this, as impressive as this might all sound….. Is it’s NOT actual HUMAN intelligence. It is just an imitation of it. The problem with A.I. is we’ve falsely assumed we’ve surpassed human intelligence when we couldn’t be further from the truth. We haven’t even replicated it, yet we seem to think we’ve reached a new era of utopia where it’s far surpassed us. We’ve still got a long way to go. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I’m also going to talk about why I don’t like A.I., which is mostly due to the FALSE image that it has implanted in our minds and WHY I’m enjoying it’s slow and inevitable downfall. I’m a HUGE tech enthusiast, and am VERY open minded to many implementations of it. Tech has advanced society to limits that I wouldn’t have imagine possible, which also lead to it HELPING a lot of people overall, as well as made things more accessible for the disabled: prosthetics, eye care, hearing impaired, etc, the list goes on. Typically technology BENEFITS EVERYONE and has a POSITIVE effect (ahem… I know what you’re thinking just go with it haha), but in the case of A.I, it has lead to the false impression of a utopia that simply WILL NEVER EXIST! One where the robots will do all the work for us so we can just sit back and relax and prosper from it. We looked only at the short term of A.I. and not the long term, and because of that, we are PAYING  a hefty price for it. It’s being used to REPLACE us, NOT HELP US. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Lastly, I’ll also be covering a few HUGE security risks and COPY right laws that come into factor regarding it. </p>

                        </h4>

						<p>A.I., which stands for Artificial Intelligence, is the overall main replication of human intelligence that implements what is known as DSA, Data Structure Algorithms, whose goal is to create an archive collective of data that we can essentially train into a program so that it can make critical decisions for us based off of the information stored in it. Think of it like raising a child, and slowly educating it over the years. The human brain has the learning capacity to retain experiences far and wise no matter how much time has passed, which is what we are trying to simulate. This is also what is commonly known as Machine Learning. One of the most commonly used programming languages for data structures is poses and brags PYTHON.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>There is a HUGE flaw to this and I’ll discuss it shortly.</p>

 </br></br>
<h4 id = "jobs" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How A.I. has impacted the Job Market? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>As you might have noticed over the past 2 years so far, roles in tech, especially with software dev and Cyber, which pay the most, have taken a HUGE dive and have been experiencing MASSIVE layoffs and reduction in overall workforce size for various infrastructures. There are many financial factors that lead to this, but one of the most influential ones that I am going to discuss today has to do with the introduction of A.I.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>A.I. has introduced the concept of automated work, which is a form of utopia that many have been craving for for a while now, essentially computers and other forms of machinery doing all the leg work for us while we just sit back and relax. In a perfect world, this would be wonderful. HOWEVER… the world doesn’t work like that.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>What has been happening is businesses have been incorporating A.I. to essentially replace staff members due to the impression that A.I. can now do all of the work for us. This is due to a topic which I’ll discuss next.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This has overall left many out of work and in fear of being replaced by A.I. which so far has been the case, but is slowly coming to a standstill due to the obvious reasons, which I’ll dive more into next.</p>

                    Today I am going to show you how to write your own custom reveshell script that can perform RCE on any system. This is taking inspiration from reveshells which have a series of RCE shells that you can download and interact with that will allow you to seamlessly achieve RCE for any remote file upload exploit.

                </br>                                                                   
                                                                    
                    Why am I covering this despite there being a site that allows you to do so? Well, much like all things involving hacking you’ll run into situations where you need to write more complex code, even code that is pre-made beforehand for an exploit which might go out of the scope of what you need said program to do. This is also due to the fact that various detection systems are able to identify signature patterns. If you know how to write your own code you can apply further obfuscation methods that will allow you to bypass security.
        
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    I am also going to show you how the code works under the hood so that you have a CLEAR understanding of how it works and how to write it yourself. 
             
                </br>
                </br>  
        
                    This WILL be in the lab upcoming, so I recommend you get good with this as the REAL exploit for the next lab is going to be a lot more complex.

                    For today’s tool video, I’m going to show you how to sniff out network traffic to spy on sensitive credentials that are sent, and WHY you should NEVER use a site unless it has HTTPS enabled on it. Be mindful, just because a site does have HTTPS enabled doesn’t mean it’s safe and secure. Threat actors tend to have phishing sites that enable the protocol to trick us into thinking it’s legit.

                    The wireshark tool, which is used for network traffic analysis, can also be used for a variety of protocol analysis, even for stuff like VOIP eavesdropping, which can allow you to spy on people’s phone call conversations over corporate networks. I’ll eventually cover stuff like that in future parts involving the tool later on.

                    The main goal is to “simulate” and show you how programming them for drones work under the hood. I’ll of course leave the working code attached. Just pay attention to how I write the code and go about the overall process and you’ll be fine.

                </br> 
        
                    For this demonstration I’ll be covering how to program them via the standard ones that come with the arduino kit. I’ll also show you how to program them via ESC motors for the drone.

                    I’ll be showing you how to program TWO versions of LCD screens that you’ll commonly see in the arduino kit for beginners. 1 of them is the standard one with MANY pin connectors attached to them which can be the most complex to setup. The other is one that is commonly and easily interchangeable which includes a ISC adapter attached to them which is seamless to install and program. 
                
                </br>
                </br>
    
                    I recommend knowing how to program both of them so you can make either work in case you are running short on supplies, OR, in the event you ONLY have one or the other. None the less it’s still staple to know how to program BOTH of them.

						<p>Much like how SQL injection is hard to learn without proper instruction, so is binary injection. What I’m going to show you today is the overall premise and concept behind the technique. This is the DEFINITIVE example and BEST way to EASILY explain how binary injection works to ANYONE that wants to learn more about it. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Binary is overall one of the HARDEST techniques to learn and master mostly due to there being FEW GOOD resources that can teach it to you. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I’m also going to write some sample code in C that will be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks, so that you can play with it and get a feel for how it works on a technical level. This will also set us up for the next part, which will be me covering how to use a debugger to analyze the code flow, as well as perform the overall exploit the manual way. There are more special surprises for binary injection coming up so do stay tuned. </p>

						<p>There are situations where web application servers will have a program with a service running binded to a port. When you connect to it, the program will run. In some cases, you’ll run into a situation where the program will ask you for user input, which is a common thing. You can fuzz it like how I showed you in previous examples to trigger a segmentation fault which can result in you landing RCE against the server side application, potentially a lot more if you can secure the source code for the application.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>To give you a better example of what I mean, run the following command nc canyouhack.us 1985. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>THIS IS A CHALLENGE IS FROM “SECURITY INNOVATION” THAT HOSTS THE <a href = "http://canyouhack.us/" style = "text-decoration: none;">“CANYOUHACK.US”</a> CHALLENGE WHICH HOSTS A BINARY EXPLOITATION SERVER LEGAL FOR TESTING. YOU CAN LOOK THIS UP BEFORE YOU RUN THE COMMAND</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Next, if you run some input you’ll notice it will close. You can’t see the end user output from the command due to security, BUT, they leave you the source code for the challenge when you go to it, which you can test against. There are vulnerable sections in the code where you can exploit it to send you the flag to solve the challenge. You have to pipe it over the nc command which you can do with certain tools of course.</p>

						<p>Last time, I showed you how to exploit vulnerable functions inside of a program via end user input in order to call other functions within the program via memory EVEN if the function is NEVER explicitly called in the program itself. This was to highlight the dangers of leaving vulnerable code within an application and how it can be exploited by threat actors to execute it which can be problematic if you’ve left stuff like backdoors in the code that the threat actor can easily piggyback off of to compromise internal infrastructures. </p>

                        <p>This time around, we are going to take it a step further and exploit the overall application to have it perform ANY form of RCE that we want against a target application whether it be in plain text format or binary format. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This is a CRUCIAL skill to master, as you’ll often run into various CTF challenges that require you to know binary exploitation, as well as overall in general if you are running some security tests. It overall comes in handy if you’re just a hacker in general and is a STAPLE skill to master. You’ll go a long way, ESPECIALLY if you plan to do forensic with this skill set. </p>

                        <h4 id = "rce" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Why is RCE with Buffer Overflow Important? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>There are situations where web application servers will have a program with a service running binded to a port. When you connect to it, the program will run. In some cases, you’ll run into a situation where the program will ask you for user input, which is a common thing. You can fuzz it like how I showed you in previous examples to trigger a segmentation fault which can result in you landing RCE against the server side application, potentially a lot more if you can secure the source code for the application.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>To give you a better example of what I mean, run the following command nc canyouhack.us 1985. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>THIS IS A CHALLENGE IS FROM “SECURITY INNOVATION” THAT HOSTS THE <a href = "http://canyouhack.us/" style = "text-decoration: none;">“CANYOUHACK.US”</a> CHALLENGE WHICH HOSTS A BINARY EXPLOITATION SERVER LEGAL FOR TESTING. YOU CAN LOOK THIS UP BEFORE YOU RUN THE COMMAND</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Next, if you run some input you’ll notice it will close. You can’t see the end user output from the command due to security, BUT, they leave you the source code for the challenge when you go to it, which you can test against. There are vulnerable sections in the code where you can exploit it to send you the flag to solve the challenge. You have to pipe it over the nc command which you can do with certain tools of course.</p>

                        </h4>

						<p>This is one of the most commonly used tools for binary exploitation, whether the code is in direct plain text format, or binary format such as an executable like a .exe file that you commonly see on windows. When you try to open one of those, should you try to do so, you’ll notice all the code is garbled and is in what is known as binary format. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Using a debugger you can analyze all the code flow and function calls on a lower lever, in some cases, being able to retrieve the code itself (minus comments as those are removed when the program is compiled), allowing you to find weak points in order to exploit the program. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I’ll be covering some of the basic commands and options, as well as explain what they do. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I RECOMMEND THAT YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT “STACKS” AND “REGISTERS” VIA ASSEMBLY, AS THIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT ON A LOWER LEVEL. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I’m still going to explain everything and keep it simple, but if you’re still lost, I recommend that you look this stuff up. </p>

                        <p>BEFORE WE START, I RECOMMEND YOU COVER MY LAST VIDEO ON THE BASICS OF BINARY EXPLOITATION. WE ARE STICKING WITH 64 BIT AS THIS IS WHAT IS COMMONLY USED TODAY!</p>

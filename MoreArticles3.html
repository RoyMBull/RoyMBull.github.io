I wanted to raise more awareness and teach people how to protect their digital identity! A lot of the article will be me addressing what happened, as well as remedies I gave her to protect herself.</p> <p></p> <p>This is also the start of a new series that is called the “DANGER!” series, where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities within system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, where I also talk about mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent such threats.</p> <p></p> <p>There will also be a LIVE demonstration for those of you who are subscribed to my patreon, to see how closely I can exploit mobile end devices in order to retrieve any and all sensitive data from the mobile end device! There will also be a step by step exploit guide walking you through the entire process as well, and how to gelocate someone’s phone and turn it into a GPS tracker!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "connected" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! Everything is connected 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest things about technology is that EVERYTHING is connected. When isn't something going online? Even stuff like electric toothbrushes are being connected to the internet. We also have stuff like smart homes and other various means of smart technology that make our lives easier. </p> <p></p> <p>The problem with all of this is that it also makes life easier for Hackers. Everything being connected extends the main scope and attack surface for them, allowing threat actors to further exploit systems in various ways. We are in a sense creating our own colossal monolithic structure where everything is both connected and further dependent on each other, which can be lethal in VARIOUS ways! </p> <p></p> <p>What do I mean by this? Well, for starters, let’s say that a hospital system that contained a multitude of life support systems were connected online and to various networks. What would happen if a threat actor with ill intentions breached the network? </p> <p></p> <p>If an attacker were to breach it, they would essentially be able to play GOD, controlling the entire system and being able to choose whether or not actual Lives were lost. If they wanted to, they could shut down all the power systems, even the backups since a lot of this stuff seems to be connected nowadays, killing EVERYONE on life support in the process.</p> <p></p> <p>Another example, would be the woman whose mobile device I talked about was breached, allowing the attacker to control her entire mobile phone and anything she gave it access to: smart home tech, Bluetooth devices, sessions that she had on, etc. The hacker was also able to ruin her credit as a lot of her personal information and files were on the system, and they happened to gain access to that as well, even sensitive contacts and messages that were directly on her phone. One little device cost her EVERYTHING and put her and the people she cares about at risk!</p> <p></p> <p>This also gets scary because, let’s say that her phone was used to authenticate to anything within an organization that she worked for. It would lead to a massive scale breach. A lot of infrastructures are still new to solid Cyber Security practices so things like this DO happen!</p> <p></p> <p>If they wanted to spoof her and do spear phishing, like I’ve mentioned, they have access to ALL of her contacts and can pull up that information. They can even spoof her number and do all sorts of nasty stuff with it, like bypassing any and all MFA she has on the phone, allowing them to even do scary stuff like wiring themselves money out of her bank account. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "traced" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! You can be traced! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Your phone is a walking GPS locator! If your phone gets hacked YOU ARE IN DANGER!</p> <p></p> <p>One of the scariest things the woman that got hacked didn’t realize.. WAS SHE WAS NOW A WALKING GPS target for them to find anytime they needed to. This meant that anytime she was around friends or family, their address and location information, or should she even connect to their home network, COULD ALL BE TRACED AND COMPROMISED in one go. She was basically a walking botnet they could command and control all in one go. </p> <p></p> <p>For many that do not realize this, your phone is connected to a cellular network via a sim card that is attached to it, allowing it to connect to the cellular network, which provides you with a private IP address that is then converted to a PUBLIC IP address that can be used to allow you to connect to the internet from your phone. </p> <p></p> <p>This means that if an attacker wanted to, they could secure your POSSIBLE location regardless of where you are as you ALWAYS tend to have your phone on you! Hackers can exploit this and ping your every move! Even if this method is debunked it's still possible to trace you with the device via other alternatives. I ran a few tests with this. If someone were to breach your device and you were connected to a personal network, such as your home network it would also be highly possible for them to ping your location since it's connected to your home network as well. You also have to keep in mind there are apps on your phone that give your location details away since you give the permission to collect that from you depending on the application.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hijacking" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! Session Hijacking/MFA bypassing 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Your mobile device is one of the greatest forms of session hijacking. Session hijacking is where you are able to breach a victim's system and “use” any sessions that are currently in progress on them. </p> <p></p> <p>For example, your Facebook session. If you tell Facebook to keep you logged in, it will generate a cookie that can be used to remember your session and progress, which you can pick up on even if you’ve powered the system on and off. This can be critical and fatal, since an attacker could exploit this should you leave your system unattended anytime in order to do stuff like: wire themselves money via Facebook pay, change your credentials, access sensitive conversations and pretend to be you, etc, and since this is on your mobile device they will of course have access to the various means to bypass MFA on your mobile device!</p> </br></br> <img src="counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Futaba_Webs/DangerMobileDeviceSecurity" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid"> <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-block" style = "background-color: black; font-weight: bold; color: gray; border-color: red;" > Click to View More </button> </div> </a>`;

I’m also going to show you how to botnet and command and control with the burp suite proxy server and how to strip any and all network traffic on a multitude of systems using it! </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "burp" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Burp Suite Proxy Server 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>The burp suite proxy server is used to intercept and analyze network traffic and handle it in various ways. It is one of the most commonly used tools when testing against OWASP vulnerabilities within web application systems. THIS IS A STAPLE TOOL THAT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO USE!</p> <p></p> <p>It can be used either for defense or for offense. In our case, we are going to talk about how it applies to offensive capabilities.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "proxy" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Proxy mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Burp suite has a feature in it that is called Proxy mode, where you can focus the tool on intercepting various network data communication methods. </p> <p></p> <p>With this particular method, you’ll be able to boot up a dummy browser session that can be used to test and track any communications that you personally send to a web application host target. Burp suite uses selenium in order to craft a test chromium browser session. </p> <p></p> <p>Why for yourself? Well, for starters, you can use the tool to gather in depth information on all the parameters and HTTP headers that are being sent to a target. You also have the ability to manipulate them and control how the server side will respond to you. It’s how hackers tend to test various fuzzing methods that will allow them to bypass security and exploit a system.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also use this feature to analyze any and all main scripts that are on the page, and follow network traffic as it pivots within the main internal, as well as any external domains that the tool might catch. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "foxy" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Foxy Proxy Mode (Firefox extension) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now, this isn’t an exact feature that is a part of the main burp suite tool set, BUT, Firefox has a dedicated extension that allows you to set up a main proxy server on a system in order to forward all traffic to a main proxy server you have in a listening state.</p> <p></p> <p>This means that for an attacker, if we wanted to, and if we got creative, WE CAN BOTNET USING BURP SUITE. You can sit this on your system on a network, configure the extension on any and all systems on the network as well as the proxy server itself, and then BOOM, you can strip any and all network traffic, deciphering any and all credentials you can intercept.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also get creative and configure burp suite as a main proxy server within the network settings of the system you are looking to infect. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "intruder" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Intruder Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This mode is used for brute force based attacks, where you can send network traffic from the main HTTP socket history, and then handle it to inject word list points in them to have the tool brute force against. You can even set up the tool to allow stuff like pitch force brute forcing which is used to test against login time outs to bypass brute force protection on a main system.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "repeater" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Repeater Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Remember how I said that the burp suite tool can be used to manipulate the HTTP parameters and other information that is sent in the main request from client to server?</p> <p></p> <p>This mode allows you to do just that, store, modify, and repeat until you get a desired response form the server. This is crucial in case you wish to do stuff like SQL injection or RCE, and you need to see additional information that isn't shown to you from the main GUI of the site page. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "decoder" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Decoder Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This IS YOUR BREAD AND BUTTER IF YOU ARE FUZZING. What this mode allows you to do is type and encode as you need to, as well as being able to decode in case you need it to do so as well. </p> <p></p> <p>Let's say for example, you found a critical flaw in a system that allows you to RCE a server, but it doesn't allow white spaces or certain characters. It can be tricky jumping back and forth between an online encoder to handle the process for you. You can use this tool to handle all of that for you and craft a clean exploit if you need to inject some code into the target.</p> <p></p> <p>These are some of the basic core features and how they work for now.

I want to focus more on talking about the overall design of the two methods and the BIG flaws in them.</p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the new Danger! Series I’m launching, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> <p>As always, any and all advanced versions of this article with a video guide if given will be for PAID patreon members only!!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "accessibility" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Accessibility vs Convenience in Cyber Security! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>One of the biggest challenges we face when implementing new security features in an infrastructure is accessibility vs convenience, the overall means to implement a new security method while also making it convenient to use. </p> <p></p> <p>Accessibility allows the end user to easily understand and interpret/apply the new approach to security, allowing it to be seamlessly implemented into the security infrastructure in various ways. </p> <p></p> <p>This in return would require it to be more convenient in order to make it more accessible to them. Take token based MFA for example. All it is, is a simple pin code that is sent to the end user, so that they can input it into a system and authenticate on top of pre-existing knowledge factors that are set in place by default. For the sake of convenience, we have it set up so that the end user can receive the code in a variety of different ways: mobile SMS messages, email, authenticator apps, etc etc, various means spread out to allow them to use the method, which in the process, also makes it more accessible for them.</p> <p></p> <p>Sounds harmless right? WRONG. By making the method more convenient and accessible, we in fact increase the overall attack surface, making it more convenient and accessible for hackers to have options in order to exploit the security method that we’ve introduced. Don’t believe me? Check out my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/danger-your-mobile-devices-vulnerable-roy-bull-futaba-webs--9u54e/?trackingId=OXrHkoIFT7mk8EkVhAcJkA%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B7CUpqjxKRHaRgkH5R2N%2BAA%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">“DANGER!Your Mobile Devices are VULNERABLE!”</a> article to learn about how one of these endpoints allows attackers to easily bypass the security method if needed. This of course, like all forms of MFA, varies depending on the layers that are within it. I’m of course ONLY talking about scenarios that involve the pin code method.</p> <p></p> <p>We need to be mindful that when implementing other endpoints for accessibility that can also apply the security method, we need to think several steps ahead, stuff like “is said endpoint secure enough to handle this feature?”, “what would happen in the event that it’s compromised”. We consistently get full of ourselves, thinking that the implementation of the method itself will suffice, that it is impenetrable, yet overlook the stuff like this, weaknesses that can turn it into rumble. </p> <p></p> <p>In terms of overall convenience, as harsh as this may sound, sometimes you need to limit how convenient it is to apply the method in order to ensure it's not easily exploitable. This can include from a wide range of stuff like either limiting how the user applies it, or, I some cases, how often the end user is required to use it, which leads into stuff like "Zero-Trust", which is a complex, yet secure form of security for any system infrastructure. I'll talk about that in another article. For now, let's stick to the main topic. </p> <p></p> <p>You can still make it more accessible and ensure that end users are able to use and implement it, but not TOO accessible if you see my main point? </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "argument" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Where am I going with this argument? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now, how does all of this apply to the topic up for discussion today? Well, believe it or not, SSO and OpenAuth, the main topic for today, as funny but not funny as this might sound, were MADE TO BE MORE CONVENIENT THAN IT IS SECURE. Don't believe me, well let me walk you through the overall concept of how these authentication methods function so that you see the point I’m trying to make. </p> <p></p> <p>Now, just to be CLEAR, I am NOT saying that whoever made this form of authentication method had the intention of NOT making it secure. I am simply just pointing out the major weaknesses in them based on how they were originally designed.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "sso">What is SSO (Single Sign On) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Single sign on is the overall concept of being able to use ONE set of credentials to authenticate and log into multiple sessions with the same credentials that were used to authenticate to the first. Typically it’s used in infrastructures that have multiple sub layers or services that you would need to authenticate to. A good example of this would be WGU’s school system that deploys this method in order to allow you to authenticate to even your outlook mailbox with just your one session that you sign into the main student portal. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "openauth" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is OpenAuth 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>This is a new form of authentication that is supposed to make sending over credentials a thing in the past, allowing you to basically send over passwordless credentials and authenticate to a system. This can also be done through mutual trusting parties such as the "Sign in with Google" option that you see on a lot of web applications that let you use your google log in session to authenticate.</p> <p></p> <p>This means that in theory if an attacker were to intercept a communication pipeline they would end up with nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>This method sounds lovely on paper, HOWEVER, there is one HUGE downfall to this… and why it needed some um… fixes cough requiring older security methods to patch it. It's one of the largest forms of a security breach waiting to happen. As a matter of fact it already has been. You can check a scenario on where OpenAuth is being used maliciously right <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/09/22/malicious-oauth-applications-used-to-compromise-email-servers-and-spread-spam/" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> in order to infect and breach systems.</p> </br> <img src="counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Futaba_Webs/DangerSSOAndOpenAuth" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid"> <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-block" style = "background-color: black; font-weight: bold; color: gray; border-color: red;" > Click to View More </button> </div> </a>`;

Which will be available for PAID patreons only. There will also be a follow up video in the next bi-weekly issues that will feature a live programming video to demonstrate the process.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hooking" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Hooking? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Hooking is the process of using covert methods, which are illegal function calls within a program in order to invoke malicious activity within a system. In a sense you can think of this as a form of living off the land, where you are exploiting a trusted application within a system to gain and further extend access to a system infrastructure. The end goal of this method is much the same as many common attack vector end goals, RCE(remote code execution), which will allow you to botnet and control systems on the network further. </p> <p></p> <p>Hooking leads into stuff like DLL and Code injection which are used in order to hook and infect the memory pages of the target application, to launch malicious payloads from within the program itself. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "dll" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is DLL injection? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>DLL injection is the process of exploiting something that is known as a dynamic library, which are a series of core functions that are loaded alongside applications on startup for any and all general purposes. This is a trusted process that the system recognizes and allows the program to perform each time it runs. There are different types of DLL files, each one pertaining to a particular operating system: kernel32.dll for windows, ld. so. conf for linux, .dylib for MAC OS systems. </p> <p></p> <p>Essentially what we are doing using this injection method, is piggybacking off of the base address of where the DLL file is being loaded from on the system, in order to spoof our address as its address to come up as a legitimate process on the main system. This is also done on top of obfuscation methods to mask our activity on the system we are infecting. We need to blend in as much as possible in order to avoid being detected!</p> <p></p> <p>This allows us to mask in our own source code, which can be used in order to infect the system further.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "code" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Code injection 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Code injection is a much similar process much like DLL injection. The key difference here is that this is more focused around the masking of shell code that is converted to hexadecimal format, and then obfuscated in order to RCE the system.</p> <p></p> <p>These two methods can be combined in order to do both in one go if needed. You can use either or to get the job done! If you get creative with it, you can nest in RCE commands, that also pipe in source code for you to infect the system with.</p> </br> <img src="counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/posts/pentest-phases-102728942" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid"> <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-block" style = "background-color: black; font-weight: bold; color: gray; border-color: red;" > Click to View More </button> </div> </a>`;

Cyber Security, as I’ve said before, is a game of chess, one that requires you to be several steps ahead in order to defend our digital landscape. </p> <p></p> <p>For one to assume there is no weakness in a system, no matter how well sound it might be, is a CRITICAL mistake, one that plagues the industry today stares at the MITIRE company data breach. Know this well… THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A 100% SECURE SYSTEM. For as long as it is man made it will always contain some form of flaw or error in them. People are able to make mistakes, therefore, said programs will also reflect said mistakes.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "bypass" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! MAC Address filtering can be bypassed! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Mac address filtering involves configuring a network access point to only allow permitted devices to authenticate and access the internal network. In the event that an unauthorized user tries to access the internal network, the MAC address that is tied to their system will be checked and flagged by the security of the access point if it isn’t registered as a permitted device. </p> <p></p> <p>For most this would appear as a great form of security overall. Only the administrator that configured the MAC address cache for the access point will be able to see which MAC addresses you need in order to be permitted to the network. Solid right? WRONG!</p> <p></p> <p>Here is the major flaw with this setup….. There are 2 EASY ways to bypass this rule.</p> <p></p> <p>#1:</p> <p></p> <p>You can tap into the direct network feed if you find an open PHYSICAL network port. This also allows you to bypass any authentication methods that might be set in place even if you manage to spoof the MAC address through other means and get blocked by the WPA2 authentication process.</p> <p></p> <p>Even if you find the right MAC address, if they have a complex password to join the network, then you’re out of luck if you try to do this the wireless method and you can't crack the password. It is possible to bypass using just the MAC address alone, but like all forms of wireless security, it's constantly improving and evolving over time, making some of these methods hard if not IMPOSSIBLE to easily pull off.</p> <p></p> <p>Physical network taps, which typically do NOT require authentication, allows you to bypass this simple filter. </p> <p></p> <p>#2:</p> <p></p> <p>The MAC addresses for any and all systems that are connected to the internal network are sent out in data packets, via “stations” that are connected to the main access point. </p> <p></p> <p>With a simple tool like Aircrack-ng, you can use monitoring mode to sniff out all the data channels and see which systems are connected to the network to spoof any and all internal MAC addresses, allowing you to bypass the security and authenticate to the network. </p> <p></p> <p>Of course there are other means to do this, but these are methods that I have tried and have succeeded with that have allowed me to breach access points that I have personally setup for these types of tests.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hiding" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! Hiding your SSID can be bypassed 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A common trick that a lot of people like to use in order to prevent unauthorized network breaches, is they like to hide their SSID’s which is the name of the network. This is effective in that you can hide SSID information from common means of exposure, like the GUI you use when selecting a wireless access point to communicate with.</p> <p></p> <p>The problem with this is it can easily be bypassed by the same method mentioned in option #2 of how to bypass MAC address filtering. </p> <p></p> <p>Your SSID is also broadcasted along with any and all MAC address information that is sent out in data packets. They have to be, otherwise our IoT devices would be unable to pick them up and identify them. THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY TO BYPASS ANYTHING! NOTHING IS 100 PERCENT SECURE!</p> <p></p> <p>Today’s positive bonuses will focus more on how to defend against MAC address filtering bypasses, preventing an attacker from breaching the network via this security method.</p> </br> <img src="counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "hhttps://futabawebs.github.io/Futaba_Webs/DangerSSIDMACFILTERING" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid"> <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-block" style = "background-color: black; font-weight: bold; color: gray; border-color: red;" > Click to View More </button> </div> </a>`;

It's the overall process of enumerating the entire file system, and then applying what is known as symmetric cryptography in order to encrypt the entire data storage medium. A good example of this would be bitlocker, which is commonly used for Windows system infrastructures.</p> <p></p> <p>As you know, data encryption is irreversible without the crypto keys, so by performing this method and leaving the keys out the hands of the attacker, should they breach the system, whether it be digitally or physically, any and all data they steal will be useless to them.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "cookies" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What are COOKIES? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Symmetric cryptography, also known as single key cryptography, is the process of using a singular crypto key known as a private key in order to both encrypt as well as decrypt data. It's commonly more used for FDE over Asymmetric due to it being the faster encryption method.</p> <p></p> <p>This makes sense as the overall process for FDE is to enumerate THE ENTIRE file system ENTIRELY and encrypt EVERY single file on the system. Asymmetric would be too slow for this as it's a slower encryption standard. It's also commonly used in mobile device data encryption as well for the same reasons.</p> <p></p> <p>Asymmetric encryption on the other hand uses two crypto keys to perform the same process, except, in this case, it uses a public key for encryption, and a private key for decryption. The main reason for this is to add more secure complexity for various data communication methods. It’s also commonly used in stuff like PGP, pretty good privacy, which is commonly used for secure email data encryption.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the BIGGEST downfalls of symmetric data encryption is it's VULNERABLE to interception attacks. Should an attacker intercept the crypto key, they can: decrypt all data and messages, replay new ones on behalf of the original recipients, and a lot more.</p> <p></p> <p>However, with Asymmetric encryption, this isn't the case. Since it uses two crypto keys which come in pairs, Should a threat actor intercept the communication pipeline and steal one of the keys, their efforts will be in vain, as they lack one of the means to facilitate a SOLID man in the middle attack.</p> <p></p> <p>The whole premise of a man in the middle attack is to not only intercept the communication, but to reply messages on behalf of the respective parties. By using public key cryptography on top of other data channel splitting techniques, you render this the ineffective and leave them in a situation where they can’t facilitate it fully.</p> <p></p> <p>Should an attacker secure the public key only, then they'll only be able to send messages. They won't be able to read any of the data that is being sent back and forth, and any new messages will be suspected as false ones, which will lead to the replacing of the keys. Even if they verify with the key, it will all be for nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>However, in the event they have the private key, they'll be able to decrypt any and all messages, BUT, they won't be able to spoof and gain further insight and other information out of the communication pipeline. This is still a problem for them due to the fact most PKI infrastructures, even stuff like PGP, REQUIRE you to have the public key BEFORE you begin a communication to ensure message authenticity from the recipients. Simply not having the public key is like a lack of ID to verify who you are…. WHICH MEANS A DEAD PRIVATE KEY! This does vary depending on the infrastructure so do be mindful as I'm going over this.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "cookiehijacking" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Cookie Session Hijacking? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Now that we've gone over the basics, let's talk about what Ransomware is.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is basically FDE with malicious intent. It's a form of malware that is known as "crypto" malware, which deploys cryptographic techniques that enumerate the victims file system, exfiltrating data from it, and then encrypting the main copy of the data on the file system, rendering it useless to them. Be mindful that "crypto" malware and "ransomware" are TWO different forms of malware. Crypto malware is the main archetype, where as Ransomware is the child of said archetype, inheriting cryptographic techniques. </p> <p></p> <p>After the data is encrypted, a message is displayed to the end user requiring them to pay a "ransom" in order to receive the crypto keys to decrypt their data, hence the name "ransomware". The problem with this is paying the ransom doesn't guarantee you will receive the keys.</p> <p></p> <p>Ransomware is on the rise for being an effective attack method because it can be combined with phage malware techniques and phishing techniques to become SUPER effective.</p> <p></p> <p>Before, a simple click of the link or mishap in security meant you had an undetected botnet. NOW, it means all your data is encrypted and unreadable, which can be problematic if you're handling sensitive data that has to do with critical record information like someone's student or home loan payment information for example.</p> <p></p> <p>Mr.Robot for example, one of their biggest exploits in the show was encrypting all of E Corp's data in order to "FREE" everyone from debt. HOWEVER, it caused quite the opposite effect, where now people that were close to being debt free, or had funds in their bank accounts, were unable to access anything or prove what they've made payments due to the data being indecipherable. The result? TOTAL CHAOS where the people they were trying to “Free” suffered more.</p> </br> <img src="counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Futaba_Webs/CookieSessionHijacking" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid"> <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-block" style = "background-color: black; font-weight: bold; color: gray; border-color: red;" > Click to View More </button> </div> </a>`;

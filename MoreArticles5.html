                    Today’s live tool demonstration is going to feature cracking SSH services using two of my favorite CLI hacking tools: Hydra and Patator. 
                </br>

                    Hydra is a commonly used tool that is use to brute force against web application servers, as well as commonly used to crack SSH, FTP, and RDP protocol services
        
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    Patator is a more advanced tool that is able to work with more services than Hydra, so it comes in handy when you need to crack something that is out of the typical scope of Hydra. It also has much more fine tune options that let you control the overall quality of the attack itself.

						<p>It’s no shocker that there are some ahem… “major” security related concerns that have been circulating about it for the past few weeks since its official announcement and release.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I’m going to talk a bit about how it works, and of course, like always, I’ll explain the dangers of it. In the more advanced version of the articles, I’m going to go over how some of the core API functions work, and how we can exploit them. Much like how in the DLL injection article where I mention there will be a followup article later on with live footage to show the exploit, the same will be the case with this article as well. This is to ensure you have the proper knowledge and that it marinates before we dive into the real thing. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Security is something that is HIGHLY neglected during many software development projects. I’ve talked a bit about this before, but if security is not kept in mind, it can lead to some pretty crazy stuff, like for example, OpenAuth and SSO. If you would like to see what I’m talking about in regards to that, you can check out this article <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/danger-sso-openauth-roy-bull-futaba-webs--8lkbe/?trackingId=mm8l%2FgXVSROEv2isf8NLvg%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>. </p>

                        <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the  advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p>

                        <h4 id = "recall" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is Windows Recall? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Windows recall is a new “snapshot” feature for Windows 11, where around every 5 seconds, the state of the system is essentially ‘screenshoted”, recording and saving the main state of the system, so that you can return back to a period in time and pick up where you left off. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>The best analogy for this would be like the screenshot method for virtual machines, where you can “screenshot” where you’re currently at on the system and resume your progress later on when you need to. It’s also portable, so if you happen to snapshot the system, you can carry it to another VM of the same type and then pop it there. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Windows Recall is a part of the main Windows Copilot Runtime , which is an AI based API.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>It relies on the User Activity API, which is a C# focused API, in order to create screenshots and encapsulate sessions that have to do with the end user data that is on the system: Overall user activity, data, data accounts, as well as any and all tasks that were running on the main system at the time.</p>

                        </br></br>
                        <h4 id = "screenshot" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a system screenshot? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>System screenshots, often performed for virtual machines, is a mechanic that allows you to screenshot  the entire state of the local system from all various endpoints: memory, tasks, running browser sessions and any cookie data with it, etc. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Think of it like “quick save” when you are playing a video game. Once you reach a certain checkpoint, OR, after a certain period of time, the game will “save” itself, in which, depending on the game, you can go back in time and pick up where you left off. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>System snapshots is also a technique that is commonly used for forensics purposes, weather it be maliciously or defensively. It can be used, for example, to retrieve crypto keys that are often stored in memory while during live run time of the system. This can be vital for data recovery purposes in case you lost the keys, OR, in the eyes of an attacker, it can be used to decrypt any and al  sensitive data with it to compromise a system infrastructure. </p>

</br></br>
                         <h4 id = "caution" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">CAUTION! READ FIRST! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Since Windows Recall is fairly new, these are just theories on how it can be exploited, which is not fully set in stone until people exploit it (which many have done so already). </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Feel free to theorize and let me know various other ways this feature can be exploited and drop a comment in the comments section bellow. </p>

                        </br></br>
                        <h4 id = "negative" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">NEGATIVE PENALTY! Recall renders data sanitation INEFFECTIVE!? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Windows Recall renders stuff like data sanitation methods on the system useless.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Wiped a few crpyo keys for proper toss the key method? Recall will help threat actors restore the system so they can retrieve it!</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Deleted files and purged them from the system so no one could view them and have a digital certificate verifying the wipe? RECALL WILL HELP THREAT ACTORS RESTORE THE SYSTEM SO THEY CAN RETRIEVE IT!</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>See where I'M going with this? No matter what you do, threat actors are able to essentially go back in time and revert the process since the main state of the system has been PERFECTLY saved in memory. At this point it's also a forensics tool for hackers in this case for data retrieval. </p>

						<p>We’ve talked about how the internet works, and things like port forwarding, the TCP/IP handshake, etc, but we’ve yet to discuss the actual HTTP methods you constantly see in stuff like burp suite for example. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>As a hacker, it’s crucial you know how they work, as you can tamper and interact with them in order to control how the server side responds to the client side of the connection. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>For this article, there will be a video, demonstrating how to write HTTP methods via BurpSuite. As always, this will be for paid patreon members only. </p>

                        </h4>

						<p>HTTP methods are a series of request types that tell the backend of the server to perform a said action, and then interact with the client in a certain way. How each one works varies depending on the one that you are using.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>The default HTTP methods that we are going to cover today are.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>🎃GET</p>

                        <p>🎃HEAD</p>

                        <p>🎃PATCH</p>

                        <h4 id = "get" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the GET HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>The GET HTTP method, the default one that is commonly used in any and all HTTP servers, is used in order to fetch data from resources on the HTTP file system. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>For example, when you enter “https:// google [.] com”, your web browser will send over a GET request to the HTTP server in order to load the page you want to view.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>It can also be used to fetch stuff like executables or files that are on the HTTP server that you wish to also download. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>It’s also common for input parameter fields, like searching a website for products on the page you wish to purchase. When you enter in the name of an item you want to purchase, a GET request is made to the backend of the server, in which it will perform a database query that will retrieve the elements form the database, placing it in the given fields where the main web application wishes to present them to you.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>For example, when you search “cats”, in lets say a website for example, the main HTTP GET request, as well as the name of the item you are searching for is processed by the backend that will allow GET requests, parsing it, and piping in a request like so</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>“SELECT makeup FROM makeuptable WHERE Product_ID=”YOUR_INPUT”. </p>


                        </br></br>
                   <h4 id = "post" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the POST HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>The POST HTTP method is commonly used in scenarios where the HTTP server needs to handle user input data and submit it,  like login data for example, or any kind of data that needs to be processed by the backend in order to perform a specific action. The backend handles said data, and then processes it to the system for a variety of purposes: resources directly on the file system, database queries, etc. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>It can also be used to upload stuff like files for remote file inclusion for example. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>It can also be used for simple retrieval purposes if needed to, but the main purpose of the request is to do what I just mentioned.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Threat actors commonly exploit the POST HTTP method in order to perform a variety of server side attacks, since, depending on how the backend of the HTTP server is configured to handle the processed data, they can manipulate the system in a variety of unique ways: SQL injection, Command injection, Cross Site Scripting, etc. </p>


                        </br></br>
                        <h4 id = "put" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the PUT HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>The PUT HTTP method is used in order to modify and update resources that are already on the HTTP server  file system. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>It can also be used, depending on how the PUT request method is programmed for the backend, be used to add an entirely new resource to the system itself. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I say this strongly because, one of the obvious things to do as a security professional would be to ONLY allow it to update resources which is what it’s designed to do.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>If a threat actor finds a way to pull this HTTP method off, they can basically remotely include as many files as they want to the server and exploit the system in a variety of ways. </p>


                        </br></br>
                        <h4 id = "delete" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the POST HTTP request? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>The DELETE HTTP method  is the opposite of the PUT HTTP request method, where instead of adding or updating files/resources on the main file system, it instead REMOVES them from the file system. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>For this one, since it’s obvious, you can wrap your head around what’ll happen if an attacker is able to pull this off.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This can be CRUCIAL for stuff like modifications to an end user account, when you change stuff like your username for example, as well as various aspects of information that need SPECIFIC ways of being updated on the HTTP server file system, that might or might not have to do with the end user specifically. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>It sounds a bit complicated, but try to process the example I’ve just mentioned</p>

                    This week we will be going over how to write a more advanced version of the Man-In-The-Browser exploit. It features some new techniques that could be of use to you. 
        
                </br> 
                </br>                                                                   
                                                                    
                    I’ll also be covering a few modules in python to stack with the exploit so you can further extend and do a lot more with it.  
        
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    This demonstration will cover how to keylog end user credentials with the exploit, and then post them to a remote server, specifically the one that we wrote in last bi-weekly’s issue regarding how to write a “HTTP Server” in Pyhton3.
                
                </br>
                </br>  
        
                    Pay close attention to this video as we are combining past things we’ve learned to make the exploit 10 times better.

                    This week’s tool tutorial I’ll be covering how to use SQLMap to perform RCE execution on a remote system featuring HackTheBox’s “Vaccine” machine”.
        
                </br> 
                </br>                                                                   
                                                                    
                    SQLMap can be used for a lot more than just performing SQL injections and dumping databases that are vulnerable to the technique. It can also be used to perform RCE execution and pop you a reverse shell. 
        
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    I’ll also be demonstrating something that has been highly requested, which is creative more advanced interactive shell upgrades once you land RCE against a system.
         
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    One of the biggest things you’ll often notice after you land RCE, is that you require a “ptty” shell which is a more interactive legit /bin.bash shell that can execute more advanced, if not all commands on the remote target system. IT’S CRUCIAL YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THIS AS IT’S PRACTICAL AND YOU’LL OFTEN HAVE TO DO SO.

                    This week I’ll be teaching you how to program a Joystick module for Arduino. This is part in the making for a more advanced lab that is coming up, which WILL require you to know how to do this.

                    I’ll also be covering some smart techniques and tricks on how to program the module correctly since it can be tricky for beginners to program it correctly on their first try. 
        
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    We’ll be putting what we’ve learned so far about how to program: switches, LED pins, as well as analog all into one go, as well as the overall basics on how to physically setup.

						<p>The main goal for today is to talk about how data encryption and secure communications aid CSAM on various social media and communications platforms: Facebook(Meta), WhatsApp, Telegram, etc etc. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Data encryption and secure communication methods such as SSL and TLS, although it can be used to protect end users and prevent interceptions via man in the middle attacks, as well as render data infeasible, it can also aid threat actors and CSAM criminals, enabling them to go undetected and remain anonymous(depending on how smart they are on the internet).</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I’m also going to talk a bit about how our privacy laws and policies can also aid threat actors as well.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>We often forget that laws not only protect the innocent, but also criminals at the same time. It’s one of the biggest reasons in the event of a real situation where there is a threat to the safety of others concerning certain forms of data, business infrastructures refuse to disclose it unless there is a certain process they undergo to safely do so. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advanced version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p>

                        <h4 id = "csam" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is CSAM? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>CSAM is “Child Sexual Abuse Material '', which is any form of sexually explicit  inappropriate content regarding adolescents and kids overall. Think (DON’T ACTUALLY THINK!!) of it like “porn” but for pedophiles. It can be collected and fabricated in various ways. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This form of content is HIGHLY illegal, where often times it’s fabrication results in the sexual assault and abuse of actual children to make it. There are even human trafficking operations where children are explicitly kidnapped for these purposes on top of other things. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Due to its nature, a lot of underground activity for it occurs on the dark net in order to serve it to its ahem… “high” following fanbase. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>There have also been other means to fabricate it such as A.I for example, which can turn pictures of children into sexually inappropriate content, or even create said content out of whatever data is available to them even if it doesn't involve actual pictures of children. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>CSAM has also gotten to the point where Kids are being harassed and extored online into sending this type of content to predators, which has lead to the deaths of many via suicide.</p>

                <h4 id = "e2e" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is End to End (E2E) Encryption? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>One of the main topics for today is to talk about the dangers of E2E encryption, and how it’s being used by companies to “turn a blind eye” to CSAM cases. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This form of encryption, although it sounds good on paper, has LOTS of fatal flaws depending on WHERE and HOW it’s used. In the event of something basic like PGP for emails or a PKI system, where public and private crypto keys are being used to exchange data for business infrastructures, this is harmless. There are also means to strip the network traffic should it be necessary for security within the infrastructure.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>In the event of how certain social media platforms implement it: Meta, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. it can be a deadly tool to allow platforms that CHILDREN operate on to be vulnerable to sex extortion cases and can be a means for servicing CSAM material.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>End to End encryption's biggest enabler for CSAM, is that NO THIRD PARTIES are able to intercept and view ANY of the traffic that is being sent between various main parties, including THE COMPANY THEMSELVES.</p>
                    </br>


                    </br></br>
                    <h4 id = "social" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">E2E allows social media platforms to turn a blind eye to CSAM! 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Ever noticed what the ruckus was when platforms like meta implemented end to end data encryption? </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>It’s not due to the fact it’s being used to secure end user text messages and data, which would be a good thing if only the case. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>The PROBLEM is these types of platforms cater to both adults and CHILDREN! They can coexist and interact with each other at the same time. Even with stuff like messenger for kids, it’s still possible to make a dummy account and interact with children.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>With end to end encryption, pedophiles and other forms of cyber criminal activity can go left unnoticed, or to better phrase it, “indecipherable’</p>

						<p>I’ve gone over how to use it for certain exploits, but I’ve never fully shown: how to set it up, what all the options mean, advanced options, how to chain and combine stuff, etc. I’m going to show you the most practical way to use the framework so that you can effortlessly hack it like a pro in no time. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I’m also going to show you one CRITICAL thing that commonly gets overlooked when using the framework. It’s an abundance of FREE knowledge, one that if you know how to use it, you’ll become one of the most skilled and dangerous hackers of all time. Think of the Metasploit as all your “past lives”. You have access to all of that information. You just need to learn how to use it properly. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This article will of course be video oriented, and will only be available to PAID patreon members only. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>It’s no shocker that it’s a staple tool in every hacker’s tool belt, but shockingly enough, due to how times have changed, I don’t quite see it picked up by newcomers or talked about enough anymore. I know it still sees light and people use it, but nowadays I rarely hear anyone post or even talk about it, and it’s one of the standard tools much like aircrack-ng. People forget that a lot of newer tools are based on the original ones that are known and loved by the hacker community.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Recently one of my favorite authors ran into an issue where someone thought recommending Aircrack-NG was a horrible idea due to how old it is, when it is in face one of THE best pentesting tools hands down to seamlessly crack various wireless encryption: WEP, WPA, WPA2, etc. Even most pentesting methodologies or tools mimic it in some shape or format just like with metasploit.</p>

                        <h4 id = "metasploit">What is Metasploit? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Metasploit is an offensive security penetration testing framework that can be used for a variety of penetration testing methodologies: web application, networking, C&C/botneting, mobile hacking, etc. It’s a multi-tool power house in case you haven’t noticed, and has left a legacy, where tools like SET, routersploit and even kali nethunter mimic in terms of overall terminal functional and design. It also has one of the best well maintained database archives of any and all exploits that exist in its database. The code written and stored in it is beyond our deserving.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Metasploit is also both an easy to use tool for beginners as well as a complex tool for more advanced folks in the hacking community, one that can require a bit of skill to use effectively. It’s also one of THE most maintained tools that you could ever pick up, as most tools, even if they’re super good and practical, lack support and maintenance, EVEN, if they happen to surpass it overall in functionality. It helps even more as most of the stuff is already there so no need to reinvent the wheel, just build on top of it, which many have like I’ve said before. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I’m going to talk about some of the opinions that you’ll see in the framework and what they mean as it can be quite confusing. </p>


                        <h4 id = "aux">Auxiliary Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>If you’ve noticed in my hacking with Shodan exploit guide, you’ll notice that when I use the shodan module, in the module address in the metasploit framework, the first part of the address begins with “auxiliary”, which indicates that that the module you are using is a form of information gathering tool. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>You can use various auxiliary tools in metasploit for various purposes: port scanning, OSNIT, etc. </p>
                    
                    
                    </br>

                    <h4 id = "exploit">Exploit Mode 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>One of the most commonly well known module formats in metasploit, the exploit module, is basically an auto pwn exploit, where you simply need to pass in the coordinates, or configuration: IP, port, any word lists depending on the module, etc, and the tool set will do ti’s thing.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>For example, for setting up reverse TCP shells, you have the classic exploit/multi-handler module which allows you to set up a multi purpose server that can be set to work with: linux, mac, and windows payloads, and auto pwn the system should you get the executable up and running on it. </p>
                    
                    </br>

                    <h4 id = "payloads">Payloads 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Payloads are an interesting feature, as MANY don’t quite understand how to use them properly.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Payloads are basically the malicious code or executable that you’d often have to use mfvenom for in order to generate them, along with setting them inside exploit modules like with hacking mobile devices to get them up and running. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>They are standalone and need to be delivered to the target in order for them to work. How you go about that is all up to you. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p> Next, I’m also going to also go over some other stuff you ONLY do with the msfvenom feature that is a part of the metasploit framework: encoders, evasion, etc.</p>

                    For today's tool demonstration, we are going to be diving more into the metasploit framework, as well as previous techniques involving IOT hacking to dive into web cam hacking.

                </br>                                                                   
                                                                    
                    One of the many features of the meterpreter shell from the metasploit framework, is that it allows you to tap into the camera feed of the IOT device you breached, meaning you can grab live video time footage of the end user, as well as any meta data that will give away their coordinates and location if you would like to strip that using tools we've covered like exiftool.

                    For today's software engineering content, we are going to dive into how to write out form requests to implement various HTTP methods from scratch, as well as how to setups basic HTML file from scratch.

                    I will be showing you how to setup form requests, as well as: text inputs, password inputs, submit modules, and lastly, file uploads for an html page.

Of course whistles I’m just theorizing. It’s not like I’ve been paid to do this stuff before right haha…. cricket noises.. AHEM… back to the point of the matter!</p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to talk about what SPOF is since it’s a CRITICAL topic that you’ll often come across in Cyber and Information security, WHICH YOU NEED TO KNOW. It’s so important that simply not knowing it is one of the MAIN reasons why we have so many security breaches and bad Cyber Security practices. </p> <p></p> <p>Lastly, since this is of course the danger series, I am going to address MANY remedies that can be done in order to enhance your overall network security, most of which you probably have never thought of in the first place. I’ve played around with a lot of this stuff, so do take my word for it. </p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advance version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "wap" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is a WAP? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>WAP, which stands for wireless access points, are the various gateway networking devices that we use to access various local networks including the internet: routers, hubs, switches, etc. They host various endpoint devices: laptops, desktops, mobile devices, CCTV systems, that are able to communicate with each other on the network via various networking protocols like TCP/IP for example, allowing them to exchange various data packets in order to communicate. Think of WAP’s, in the case of this article, like your “house”, where you are trying to “protect” it. You still following me? Good!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "spof" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is SPOF 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>SPOF, which stands for Single Point of Failure is when one endpoint or vulnerability leads to a SIGNIFICANT compromise of a multitude of systems in an infrastructure(s). </p> <p></p> <p>For example, the common element of a human factor via phishing and social engineering. It doesn't matter how many security factors you have at play, if even ONE person screws up and lets the threat actor in, then it is all for naught, hence it is a SPOF.</p> <p></p> <p>Let’s try another factor, but this time a bit more technical. Let’s say you happen to have multiple endpoints with application systems on them facing each other, many of which have access to each other's resources, even the most critical ones. In the event should ONE of these systems, or even if it were a singular system that was connected to everything in the same manner, it would lead to a MASSIVE SPOF that could do some heavy damage to the infrastructure. </p> <p></p> <p>Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, let’s dive into the main dangers that could happen should a your WAP happen to be compromised. </p> </br></br> <h4 id = "hackers" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Your WAP aid’s hackers 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>Anonymity is one of the biggest assets for a threat actor. It allows them to go undetected and remain untraced. There are NUMEROUS ways to go about this: burner phones, burner laptops, tor, FREE wifi spots, etc, BUT, did you know that YOUR AP(Access Point) can be used as a means to allow threat actors to keep their anonymity. </p> <p></p> <p>Now this doesn’t sound too bad right? Someone wants to use your wifi without your consent, not a big deal! WRONG! It becomes a HUGE deal when what they are doing is being traced back to YOUR location and IP address. Even if you are innocent, if the odds are law enforcement tracks back malicious activity to your IP address you suddenly are thrown under the bus by something you didn’t do. </p> <p></p> <p>Everything I’m saying is a COMMON tactic that hackers use to stay off the radar. If you use someone elses WIFI, it even let’s you do the one thing threat actors should NEVER do, which is hack from the comfort of your own home.</p> </br> <img src="counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Futaba_Webs/DangerWAP" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid"> <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-block" style = "background-color: black; font-weight: bold; color: gray; border-color: red;" > Click to View More </button> </div> </a>`;

BUT, don’t be misled by what you see on paper. Not everything translates well. </p> <p></p> <p>The main overall goal of A.I., which stands for “Artificial intelligence”, as I’ve mentioned, is to serves to overall be a replication of human intelligence. That’s the goal of computing technology overall, as we’ve quite LITERALLY tricked an actual rock into THINKING… AND IT WORKED. Computing technology is supposed to be an extension as well as amplification of the human intellect and capabilities. So far we have computers that are able to follow instructions and perform tasks with 100 percent accuracy and proficiency at incomprehensible speeds…. just as long as it’s been programmed to do so CORRECTLY of course. The big downside of this, as impressive as this might all sound….. Is it’s NOT actual HUMAN intelligence. It is just an imitation of it. The problem with A.I. is we’ve falsely assumed we’ve surpassed human intelligence when we couldn’t be further from the truth. We haven’t even replicated it, yet we seem to think we’ve reached a new era of utopia where it’s far surpassed us. We’ve still got a long way to go. </p> <p></p> <p>I’m also going to talk about why I don’t like A.I., which is mostly due to the FALSE image that it has implanted in our minds and WHY I’m enjoying it’s slow and inevitable downfall. I’m a HUGE tech enthusiast, and am VERY open minded to many implementations of it. Tech has advanced society to limits that I wouldn’t have imagine possible, which also lead to it HELPING a lot of people overall, as well as made things more accessible for the disabled: prosthetics, eye care, hearing impaired, etc, the list goes on. Typically technology BENEFITS EVERYONE and has a POSITIVE effect (ahem… I know what you’re thinking just go with it haha), but in the case of A.I, it has lead to the false impression of a utopia that simply WILL NEVER EXIST! One where the robots will do all the work for us so we can just sit back and relax and prosper from it. We looked only at the short term of A.I. and not the long term, and because of that, we are PAYING a hefty price for it. It’s being used to REPLACE us, NOT HELP US. </p> <p></p> <p>Lastly, I’ll also be covering a few HUGE security risks and COPY right laws that come into factor regarding it. </p> <p></p> <p>This article is a part of the Danger! Series, which is where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well. If by chance there is an exploit video for me showing the full potential risk, it will be included in the advanced version of this article for PAID patreon members only!</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "ai" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is A.I.? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>A.I., which stands for Artificial Intelligence, is the overall main replication of human intelligence that implements what is known as DSA, Data Structure Algorithms, whose goal is to create an archive collective of data that we can essentially train into a program so that it can make critical decisions for us based off of the information stored in it. Think of it like raising a child, and slowly educating it over the years. The human brain has the learning capacity to retain experiences far and wise no matter how much time has passed, which is what we are trying to simulate. This is also what is commonly known as Machine Learning. One of the most commonly used programming languages for data structures is poses and brags PYTHON.</p> <p></p> <p>There is a HUGE flaw to this and I’ll discuss it shortly.</p> </br></br> <h4 id = "jobs" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How A.I. has impacted the Job Market? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </h4> <p>As you might have noticed over the past 2 years so far, roles in tech, especially with software dev and Cyber, which pay the most, have taken a HUGE dive and have been experiencing MASSIVE layoffs and reduction in overall workforce size for various infrastructures. There are many financial factors that lead to this, but one of the most influential ones that I am going to discuss today has to do with the introduction of A.I.</p> <p></p> <p>A.I. has introduced the concept of automated work, which is a form of utopia that many have been craving for for a while now, essentially computers and other forms of machinery doing all the leg work for us while we just sit back and relax. In a perfect world, this would be wonderful. HOWEVER… the world doesn’t work like that.</p> <p></p> <p>What has been happening is businesses have been incorporating A.I. to essentially replace staff members due to the impression that A.I. can now do all of the work for us. This is due to a topic which I’ll discuss next.</p> <p></p> <p>This has overall left many out of work and in fear of being replaced by A.I. which so far has been the case, but is slowly coming to a standstill due to the obvious reasons, which I’ll dive more into next.</p> </br> <img src="counter.png" class="img-responsive" alt="portfolio img"> </br></br> <p> If you like to see the more advanced version of this article that talks about methods that can be used to mitigate, as well as any videos included, SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON CYBER SECURITY TIER! </p> </br> </br> - The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸 </p> <a href = "https://futabawebs.github.io/Futaba_Webs/DANGER_AI" style = "text-decoration: none;"> <div class="d-grid"> <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-block" style = "background-color: black; font-weight: bold; color: gray; border-color: red;" > Click to View More </button> </div> </a>`;

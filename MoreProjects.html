                        I’ve participated in various high level complex CTF challenges, some of which landed me interviews at companies that had them as a part of their hiring process such as: “Security Innovation”, “Brainnest Consulting”, as well as “Chip Scan”.

                        I also do a bunch of platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe, as well as the many 6 that are available on “Canyouhack[.]us” which was provided by “Security Innovation”.

                        I’m also a Pico CTF competitor, and have even done a few high level forensics challenges that involve high level cryptanalysis techniques to decipher hidden data, as well as rebuild, analyze, and compile them.

                        All of the CTF’s I’ve participated in inspired me to create my own known as “Futaba’s Playground”

                        I wrote a test sample to demonstrate how ransomware targets and infects a victim system via file enumeration and disk encryption tactics such as RSA and AES encryption. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        For this test specifically I am only using RSA encryption.

                    </br>
                </br>

                        The code basically creates a directory with a series of files with a bit of sample data in them, creates crypto keys to use for the experiment, enumerates and locates all the root files in the folder, and then handles them via encrypting the files, showing you the cipher text, and then reversing the process to decrypt it in front of you. It even tests the keys by asking you to input data when it launches so that you see the program works.

                        I wrote a Man-In-The-Browser exploit that is able to sit in place via the use of exceptions to monitor and track end user browser sessions to keylog facebook credentials from the end user.

                </br>

                        I ran into a HUGE issue during trial and error with the code. Whenever the end user would clickoff off the page, the code would be unable to find the form elements, breaking the code. What I NEED it to do is, when  the end user leaves the page, or should they be on the same site but the code can’t find the elements, is for the for loop to break, bringing us back to the main while loop so that the process to check for sites begins again. To get around this I set up an exception handler.

                        Self-Taught Cyber Security Professional with a background in Software Engineering, IT Technical Support, Security Engineering, and proficiency in Electrical engineering and Reverse Engineering. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        I have a love and passion for offensive security. I reverse engineer various core API’s and technologies in order to explore and fabricate new ideas that will make my projects come to life.  

                    </br>
                </br>

                        I use my Software Engineering skills to design custom exploits and penetration testing tools, and CTF servers that demonstrate my Security Engineering skills and ingenious ingenuity. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        My Electrical Engineering skills allow me to devise various custom tools such as keyboard injection exploits that manipulate the virtual keyboard API of a system in order to inject payloads and bypass security measures for security testing, some with the ability to write their own code, which I use to extend further C/C++ Win32API and LinuxAPI exploits along with python scripts.

                    </br>
                </br>

                        On top of being proficient in C/C++ I’m also proficient in 13 programming languages in total, my main ones being: C/C++, Python3, Bash, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, and of course a bit of Powershell scripting as well. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        My IT skills are on par with level 4 tier experience. I use my reverse engineering skills in order to deduce probable causes and solutions for technical problems. 

                    </br>
                </br>
                        Reverse engineering is my specialty and is how I learn. Given my level of ingenuity, I was allowed to operate above my tier level and demonstrate my skill sets to the fullest and solve lots of complex technical problems at the companies that I worked at, including the infamous Pfizer Pharmaceutical company, which I have thorough documentation of in my research portfolio.

                    </br>
                </br>
                
                        My skill sets won’t disappoint you! Check out my work and my research. I take pride in what I do as a professional hacker.

                    </br>
                </br>

                        I’m also a Pico CTF competitor, and have even done a few high level forensics challenges that involve high level cryptanalysis techniques to decipher hidden data, as well as rebuild, analyze, and compile them.

                        I wrote a test sample to demonstrate how ransomware targets and infects a victim system via file enumeration and disk encryption tactics such as RSA and AES encryption. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        For this test specifically I am only using RSA encryption.

                    </br>
                </br>

                        The code basically creates a directory with a series of files with a bit of sample data in them, creates crypto keys to use for the experiment, enumerates and locates all the root files in the folder, and then handles them via encrypting the files, showing you the cipher text, and then reversing the process to decrypt it in front of you. It even tests the keys by asking you to input data when it launches so that you see the program works.

                        I've always wanted to have one of my rubber ducky scripts write its own code In a cool way, so I figured why not combine that with a LAN turtle.

                        I'm even working on a version of this that acts as retro malware to disable security systems in place, allowing me to install any backdoor.

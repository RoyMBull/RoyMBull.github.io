                        I’ve included a safe UDP backdoor to run that only works on one system via 2 terminals. I’ve excluded the full version for safety purposes that utilizes TCP/IP in order to allow for remote data communication between said systems on the networks. Feel free to check out the SSH version.

                        I’ve also created my own personal MITB(Man in the browser attack) program, that will launch a total “real” chrome browser (read the code in the description to download the module needed to run the program), which will keep track of any sites written in the code, and will log it down into a text file. For safety purposes it only tells you whether you visited the site or not.

                </br>

                        I’ve also written my own personal RSA encryption/decryption tool you can use to secure data. The program has a manual mode I’ve written that will explain how to use it.

                        I primarily use python to program a series of low-level networking tools: Client/Servers via TCP, UDP, and SSH, HTML and flask Servers, as well as network sniffers to scan and monitor traffic on networks by sending UDP packet datagrams to wait for responses and see what machines I can talk to, as well as interacting with a variety of different network protocols. I also use python to develop: Encryption/Decryption tools, Man in the browser attack programs, mapping web applications, web brute forcing, as well as to develop trojan programs that I can update and communicate with on different systems, as well as for SQL injection attacks. I’m learning machine learning with python at the moment, and I do also use it to develop fast GUI’s for pentesting tools using PYQT5.

                        This is an interchangeable rubber ducky script I wrote designed to run and execute various payloads. For demonstration purposes I’ve provided a safe version of the code you can run and script onto an arduino board that utilizes a micro USB port (The arduino Keyboard library only works with those types of boards). 
                        
                    </br>
                </br>
                
                        Simply load up the arduino program and sketch “KeyboardInjectionLINUX.ino” to the board and the sample code will run. I’ve also included a set of functions in a text file, that you can use to edit and swap out functions in the original code should you wish to. Have fun!!!

                        This is a second build of a penetration testing app I've developed that is meant to automate a variety of the different tools I've written. The interface only includes code that has been fully tested thoroughly. Any others, feel free to browse and look at it. You won't see it in the interface but it's there in case you wish to see it. The following to look at first are:
                    </br>
                </br>

                        Bash_Interface.py (This is the main interface)
                        
                    </br>
                </br>

                        LinuxInstall.py (Installs all needed components, including PYQ5 in case you don't have it installed. Also compatible with windows via pip installer)
                        
                    </br>
                </br>

                        Installer Module.sh(Script that will install all needed compilers for Linux should you not have them installed)

                        Inspired by Marcus's drone from Watch Dogs 2 and as a tribute to the series, I'm developing a penetration testing drone, it's sole purpose, to fly around capturing packet data, as well as cracking Wireless encryptions, integrating the use of a raspberry pi zero to host my UDP BackDoor Server program in order to communicate with the drone and see what's on the pi as it's flying. Think of it as a flying wifi-pineapple. When the drone boots up, the pi zero will auto login, where a set of scripts will run, starting up the UDP Server.

                    </br>
                </br>

                        The flight controller for the drone is built up from scratch, rather than using a pre-built one. The drone will take a series of commands from the transmitter, the controller, also built from scratch (keyboard input option available as well), and depending on the value read from the analog of the joystick module, will move the drone either: forward, backward, left, right, up down, and shifts the values of the signal values sent to the ESC's of the drone in order to move the drone accordingly, all calibrated properly. The drone is still in prototype phase, and is near completion.

                    </br>
                </br>

                        In the future I will be diving into how to facial recognition software, which I will build from scratch in order to build a true replica of Wrench from Watch Dogs 2, his face mask that acts as a build board, where his facial expressions are scanned by the mask in order to display a a set of emojis that show his emotions.

                        This is a custom portable CTF server that I wrote in: HTML/CSS/JS, and PHP. Further languages used are SQL for the backend of the database which is MYSQL. The server is designed to allow you to pentest wherever you are locally vs the traditional meas of having to be connected to the internet in order to engage in web application pentesting CTF challenges, allowing you to get practice wherever you are on the go. 
                        
                    </br>
                </br>
                        It’s also home lab friendly and allows you to practice network penetration testing as well, and includes a variety of challenges that test a lot of your hacking methodology and skill sets. You’re going to have to apply yourself and LEARN if you want to secure all “11 flags”.

                        You can run this challenge as either locally on your system, or on another system that you can run either directly or vm machine. This makes it more accessiible to all users. If you have nethunter you can also participate in the challenge as well from you phone if you wanted to try mobile hacking.

                        THIS DOES RUN ON NETHUNTER AS WELL THE SAME WAY. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE ROOT WHEN YOU RUN NETHUNTER SO THE SCRIPT WORKS CORRECTLY OTHERWISE IT WILL CRASH AND FAIL!

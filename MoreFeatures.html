                        I wrote a test sample to demonstrate how ransomware targets and infects a victim system via file enumeration and disk encryption tactics such as RSA and AES encryption. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        For this test specifically I am only using RSA encryption.

                    </br>
                </br>

                        The code basically creates a directory with a series of files with a bit of sample data in them, creates crypto keys to use for the experiment, enumerates and locates all the root files in the folder, and then handles them via encrypting the files, showing you the cipher text, and then reversing the process to decrypt it in front of you. It even tests the keys by asking you to input data when it launches so that you see the program works.

                        I ran into a HUGE issue during trial and error with the code. Whenever the end user would clickoff off the page, the code would be unable to find the form elements, breaking the code. What I NEED it to do is, when  the end user leaves the page, or should they be on the same site but the code can’t find the elements, is for the for loop to break, bringing us back to the main while loop so that the process to check for sites begins again. To get around this I set up an exception handler.

                        The script is able to inject a payload into the URL parameter of the web server while pre-loading a cookie session that has been assigned to it, solving the challenge, and storing the results for us in a file, in which we can parse through to check for the flag.

                        This is a custom portable CTF server that I wrote in: HTML/CSS/JS, and PHP. Further languages used are SQL for the backend of the database which is MYSQL. The server is designed to allow you to pentest wherever you are locally vs the traditional meas of having to be connected to the internet in order to engage in web application pentesting CTF challenges, allowing you to get practice wherever you are on the go. 
                        
                    </br>
                </br>
                        It’s also home lab friendly and allows you to practice network penetration testing as well, and includes a variety of challenges that test a lot of your hacking methodology and skill sets. You’re going to have to apply yourself and LEARN if you want to secure all “11 flags”.

                        You can run this challenge as either locally on your system, or on another system that you can run either directly or vm machine. This makes it more accessiible to all users. If you have nethunter you can also participate in the challenge as well from you phone if you wanted to try mobile hacking.

                        THIS DOES RUN ON NETHUNTER AS WELL THE SAME WAY. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE ROOT WHEN YOU RUN NETHUNTER SO THE SCRIPT WORKS CORRECTLY OTHERWISE IT WILL CRASH AND FAIL!

                        I’ve included a safe UDP backdoor to run that only works on one system via 2 terminals. I’ve excluded the full version for safety purposes that utilizes TCP/IP in order to allow for remote data communication between said systems on the networks. Feel free to check out the SSH version.

                        I’ve also created my own personal MITB(Man in the browser attack) program, that will launch a total “real” chrome browser (read the code in the description to download the module needed to run the program), which will keep track of any sites written in the code, and will log it down into a text file. For safety purposes it only tells you whether you visited the site or not.

                </br>

                        I’ve also written my own personal RSA encryption/decryption tool you can use to secure data. The program has a manual mode I’ve written that will explain how to use it.

                        I primarily use python to program a series of low-level networking tools: Client/Servers via TCP, UDP, and SSH, HTML and flask Servers, as well as network sniffers to scan and monitor traffic on networks by sending UDP packet datagrams to wait for responses and see what machines I can talk to, as well as interacting with a variety of different network protocols. I also use python to develop: Encryption/Decryption tools, Man in the browser attack programs, mapping web applications, web brute forcing, as well as to develop trojan programs that I can update and communicate with on different systems, as well as for SQL injection attacks. I’m learning machine learning with python at the moment, and I do also use it to develop fast GUI’s for pentesting tools using PYQT5.

For demonstration purposes I’ve provided a safe version of the code you can run and script onto an arduino board that utilizes a micro USB port (The arduino Keyboard library only works with those types of boards).

                        Simply load up the arduino program and sketch “KeyboardInjectionLINUX.ino” to the board and the sample code will run. I’ve also included a set of functions in a text file, that you can use to edit and swap out functions in the original code should you wish to. Have fun!!!

                        Inspired by Marcus's drone from Watch Dogs 2 and as a tribute to the series, I'm developing a penetration testing drone, it's sole purpose, to fly around capturing packet data, as well as cracking Wireless encryptions, integrating the use of a raspberry pi zero to host my UDP BackDoor Server program in order to communicate with the drone and see what's on the pi as it's flying. Think of it as a flying wifi-pineapple. When the drone boots up, the pi zero will auto login, where a set of scripts will run, starting up the UDP Server.

                    </br>
                </br>

                        The flight controller for the drone is built up from scratch, rather than using a pre-built one. The drone will take a series of commands from the transmitter, the controller, also built from scratch (keyboard input option available as well), and depending on the value read from the analog of the joystick module, will move the drone either: forward, backward, left, right, up down, and shifts the values of the signal values sent to the ESC's of the drone in order to move the drone accordingly, all calibrated properly. The drone is still in prototype phase, and is near completion.

                    </br>
                </br>

                        In the future I will be diving into how to facial recognition software, which I will build from scratch in order to build a true replica of Wrench from Watch Dogs 2, his face mask that acts as a build board, where his facial expressions are scanned by the mask in order to display a a set of emojis that show his emotions.

                        Today we are going to be talking about how to build a custom backdoor exploit in Python3, as well as what RCE is, including various methods to achieve it. These two techniques are your bread and butter and are what you’ll be going for during a lot of pentests, CTF challenges, etc, regardless of how you go about it: SQL injection, OS command injection, remote file inclusion, etc. It’s really all the same. 
                        
                    </br>
                </br>

                        If you’ve ever noticed, during a lot of big hacks, one of the most common things that ALWAYS happens is that the attackers somehow discover a way to RCE the system, allowing them to gain backdoor access and formulate something called a “botnet”, allowing them to deliver various payloads and command and control the network. Before I dive into this, as always I want to get you up to speed on some terminology so that you understand what’s going on. Let’s go over the main TCP/IP handshake so you understand the overall process.

                        Today we are going to be covering the Shodan API and how to use it for CCTV hacking to tap into camera feeds, as well as how to gather information about various IoT gateway devices on the internet and exploit the services on them. 
                    
                    </br>
                </br>

                        This is also going to dive into complex topics like: port forwarding, router exploitation, the routersploit framework, the metasploit framework, as well as how the internet works under the hood. 
                        
                    </br>
                </br>

                        I'm not going to directly tap into a camera feed live as that's illegal (even if it's a public cam for a park), but I am going to show you how to talk to specific ports using an IP address, whether it be in numeral format or alphabetical format. It's the same process you'll be using to tap into camera feeds should you find an open port.

                    </br>
                </br>
                
                        For this demonstration, since we'll be using metasploit for it, you're going to need a Shodan premium membership to get a lifetime API key(s). Sadly, Shodan now requires you to be a premium member if you wish to use the API freely.

                        Today, I'm going to show you how to make your own custom LAN turtle Rubber Ducky using Arduino. This is going to simulate connecting the target system back to a server side, much like a meterpreter shell, so that we can pipe over commands on our end and control the target system. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        The two scripts that are going to be used are the ones from the previous article on "How to Botnet". The client side is going to be integrated with Arduino, where it will will write its own code live and connect back to the server, whereas the server side, the python script, is going to sit in a listening state on the system, waiting for the client to connect to it so it can be fed instructions from the client side to control the system. Traditionally you always want to have the server sitting on the victim system so that you can connect and interact with it, but nowadays making your back-doors peer to peer is actually best because it allows your setup to be more versatile. For safety purposes, it's just going to connect back and that's it, nothing else! The real version that is unsafe to use stays with me. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        Sadly, this is one of those projects that you NEED to have the right equipment for to pull off, but you can still follow along the 2 demonstration videos here. One, that shows the code being automated, and then another, of me connecting it live in front of you as proof it works.

                        SOOOOOO, as promised, here is the list of any and all resources I wanted to openly share of mine that I personally recommend and use all the time. It's a special celebration for finally reaching close to 300 connections on here.

                    </br>
                </br>

                        If you would like to help other people have access to free resources so they can learn, then I suggest MEGA sharing this so that connections in your network see it!

                        Today we are going to talk about Social Engineering, specifically, a "man in the browser" exploit, as well as what social engineering is and how threat actors use it to exploit and leverage a system to gain access. There are various forms of social engineering, and we'll cover them all here today.

                    </br>
                </br>

                        Social engineering is one of the most commonly used tactics, as well as something that is known as a physical hack.

                </br>

                        As always, before we dive right into this, some terminology needs to be explained so that you can follow along with the article.

                        Today, in order to celebrate the launching of my new website, I have a special article for today. It's going to feature the first episode of  "Mr.Robot", where Elliot hacks a pedophile.

                        Self-Taught Cyber Security Professional with a background in Software Engineering, IT Technical Support, Security Engineering, and proficiency in Electrical engineering and Reverse Engineering. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        I have a love and passion for offensive security. I reverse engineer various core API’s and technologies in order to explore and fabricate new ideas that will make my projects come to life.  

                    </br>
                </br>

                        I use my Software Engineering skills to design custom exploits and penetration testing tools, and CTF servers that demonstrate my Security Engineering skills and ingenious ingenuity. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        My Electrical Engineering skills allow me to devise various custom tools such as keyboard injection exploits that manipulate the virtual keyboard API of a system in order to inject payloads and bypass security measures for security testing, some with the ability to write their own code, which I use to extend further C/C++ Win32API and LinuxAPI exploits along with python scripts.

                    </br>
                </br>

                        On top of being proficient in C/C++ I’m also proficient in 13 programming languages in total, my main ones being: C/C++, Python3, Bash, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, and of course a bit of Powershell scripting as well. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        My IT skills are on par with level 4 tier experience. I use my reverse engineering skills in order to deduce probable causes and solutions for technical problems. 

                    </br>
                </br>
                        Reverse engineering is my specialty and is how I learn. Given my level of ingenuity, I was allowed to operate above my tier level and demonstrate my skill sets to the fullest and solve lots of complex technical problems at the companies that I worked at, including the infamous Pfizer Pharmaceutical company, which I have thorough documentation of in my research portfolio.

                    </br>
                </br>
                
                        My skill sets won’t disappoint you! Check out my work and my research. I take pride in what I do as a professional hacker.

                    I’m a self-taught software engineer with a background in cyber security/penetration testing, and have been programming for over 11 years now. One of my specialties is reverse engineering. I like to reverse engineer various core API’s and technologies in order to explore and fabricate new ideas that will make my projects come to life. My favorite video game series known as the MBNS(Megaman Battle Network Series) inspired me to want to learn how to code/program.

                    The name Futaba_Webs was inspired from my list of favorite video game characters that are hackers: Futaba from Persona 5, Wrench from WatchDogs 2, and Sombra from Overwatch. The other half of my name, Webs, is inspired from my love of the way of the spider, Spider-Man, my favorite spider(s) being, Spider-Gwen and Superior Spider-Man.

                    This iconic phrase you see all the time on all of my stuff is inspired from DC’s “The Batman Who Laughs”. The pumpkins and the overall theme of where I’m going with them is inspired from “Jack-O'' from my favorite fighting game series of all time “Guilty Gear “, as well as my favorite Marvel SuperHero, “Spider-Man”. The overall theme of this in the long run is to create my own version of a “Spider” that combines all the iconic themes together.

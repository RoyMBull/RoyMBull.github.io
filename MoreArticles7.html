                    For today’s tool video, I’m going to show you how to use the smbclient tool in order to sniff out and exploit smb file shares on windows systems to retrieve a sensitive file that contains password end user credentials.
        
                </br> 
                </br>                                                                   
                                                                    
                    File shares are one of the most CRITICAL end points to protect on any system. There’s a reason why OS systems CLOSE their ports by default on most systems. 
        
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    Should a threat actor be able to breach the service, they will have access to any and all file shares on the system, as well as being able to upload and replace and or tamper with files within the FTP service. This can lead to a lot more complex exploits like living off the land for example.

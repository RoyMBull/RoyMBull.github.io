                        Self-Taught Cyber Security Professional with a background in Software Engineering, IT Technical Support, Security Engineering, and proficiency in Electrical engineering and Reverse Engineering. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        I have a love and passion for offensive security. I reverse engineer various core API’s and technologies in order to explore and fabricate new ideas that will make my projects come to life.  

                    </br>
                </br>

                        I use my Software Engineering skills to design custom exploits and penetration testing tools, and CTF servers that demonstrate my Security Engineering skills and ingenious ingenuity. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        My Electrical Engineering skills allow me to devise various custom tools such as keyboard injection exploits that manipulate the virtual keyboard API of a system in order to inject payloads and bypass security measures for security testing, some with the ability to write their own code, which I use to extend further C/C++ Win32API and LinuxAPI exploits along with python scripts.

                    </br>
                </br>

                        On top of being proficient in C/C++ I’m also proficient in 13 programming languages in total, my main ones being: C/C++, Python3, Bash, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, and of course a bit of Powershell scripting as well. 

                    </br>
                </br>

                        My IT skills are on par with level 4 tier experience. I use my reverse engineering skills in order to deduce probable causes and solutions for technical problems. 

                    </br>
                </br>
                        Reverse engineering is my specialty and is how I learn. Given my level of ingenuity, I was allowed to operate above my tier level and demonstrate my skill sets to the fullest and solve lots of complex technical problems at the companies that I worked at, including the infamous Pfizer Pharmaceutical company, which I have thorough documentation of in my research portfolio.

                    </br>
                </br>
                
                        My skill sets won’t disappoint you! Check out my work and my research. I take pride in what I do as a professional hacker.

I also develop and create educational resources that will help people learn how to program, as well as paint the clear pathway to the cyber security field and all it’s intricacies. The most difficult part of learning anything is knowing where to start.

                    I’m a self-taught software engineer with a background in cyber security/penetration testing, and have been programming for over 11 years now. One of my specialties is reverse engineering. I like to reverse engineer various core API’s and technologies in order to explore and fabricate new ideas that will make my projects come to life. My favorite video game series known as the MBNS(Megaman Battle Network Series) inspired me to want to learn how to code/program.

                <h3 class = "pb-2" style = "font-weight: bold; color: gray">  Why the name Futaba_Webs? </h3>
                
                <p class = "pb-5"> 
                    
                    The name Futaba_Webs was inspired from my list of favorite video game characters that are hackers: Futaba from Persona 5, Wrench from WatchDogs 2, and Sombra from Overwatch. The other half of my name, Webs, is inspired from my love of the way of the spider, Spider-Man, my favorite spider(s) being, Spider-Gwen and Superior Spider-Man.

                </p>


                <h3 class = "pb-2" style = "font-weight: bold; color: gray"> The Hacker Who Laughs 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸  </h3>
                
                <p class = "pb-5"> 
                    
                    This iconic phrase you see all the time on all of my stuff is inspired from DC’s “The Batman Who Laughs”. The pumpkins and the overall theme of where I’m going with them is inspired from “Jack-O'' from my favorite fighting game series of all time “Guilty Gear “, as well as my favorite Marvel SuperHero, “Spider-Man”. The overall theme of this in the long run is to create my own version of a “Spider” that combines all the iconic themes together.

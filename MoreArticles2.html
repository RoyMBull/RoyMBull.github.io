                        Any and all forms of sexist behavior and inappropriate comments are STRICTLY forbidden for this post. This is a month where we celebrate the rich history of women and the major overall role of women in tech, in my case the big contributions for tech that they have made over the years that they haven’t received the credit that has been long overdue. Without women in tech Cyber Security and all forms of modern technology, as well as programming languages and methodologies wouldn’t exist without them. Now, let’s begin!

                        Today I am going to be handling one of the most TRIGGERING topics in Cyber Security. PROGRAMMING! Anti-Programmers Beware!!!!

                        People often feel there should be a motion for programming to become less relevant  in Cyber  Security because they never code on the job, and that it increases the barrier for entry way into Cyber Security, but they couldn't be more farther from the truth. I’m going to explain today why programming plays an important role in Cyber Security and why it’s important to learn how to code.

                        Any and all forms of sexist behavior and inappropriate comments are STRICTLY forbidden for this post. This is a month where we celebrate the rich history of women and the major overall role of women in tech, in my case the big contributions for tech that they have made over the years that they haven’t received the credit that has been long overdue. Without women in tech Cyber Security and all forms of modern technology, as well as programming languages and methodologies wouldn’t exist without them. Now, let’s begin!

                        Today, we are going to go over one of my favorite exploits, the EVIL TWIN ATTACK! This exploit focuses on kicking end users off their main network or posing as a legitimate one for end users to connect to so we can phish them and compromise sensitive data.                                    
                                            
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    
                        Typically this is done using something that is known as “Wifi Pineapple” from Hack5. The tool is designed to masquerade as a legitimate network access point and trick end users into connecting, posing as the router and intercepting any and all exit node traffic data that is sent to it, stripping it in the process to bypass secure communication methods. It interconnects with the main access point in the process and forwards the communication on its behalf to your target destination as if nothing ever happened. 
                                        
                    </br>
                    </br>
        
                        But, WE'RE much better than that. You shouldn't have to rely on someone else’s tool to get the job done. Are you a hacker or aren't you? I'm going to show you HOW to perform the exploit without one and the raw natural science behind it.

                        HOWEVER, since this involves WIFI hacking and network penetration testing, I recommend you check out my previous article that covers more on this topic as it goes over a lot of terminology that you might be unfamiliar with.

                            Today we are going to be talking about the many malware types that exist. As many of you know, I LOVE writing malware and various penetration testing tools, as well as reverse engineering them in order to see what techniques I can pluck off from them.

                            Sadly, because there are so many, I can’t talk about them otherwise the article would be 7 pages long, so instead, I’ll talk about a select few.

We are also going to cover how to create payloads and format and encode them with a tool from the metaploit framework called “msfvenom”.

                        For today's demonstration, I’m going to demonstrate how to hack into a Linux system using a meterpreter payload. Everything I am going to show here, carries over to the other platforms I mentioned since it’s rinse and repeat. I’ll include any and all special commands that are tailored for mobile hacking while going over the exploit.

                        For this tutorial I highly recommend you check out my article on how to botnet, which covers a lot of the core basics on  how to use the metasploit framework.

                        Today, we are going to go over something fun, and do a CTF, one which involves cipher  analysis and a bit of binary analysis in order to solve it. This is also going to cover a bit of obfuscation techniques such as using an encoder to mask the contents of the file to change it’s overall file structure and throw off either as

                        Today I want to talk about a hot topic that has been on the rise in regards to Cyber Security news lately, even prior to its official announcement… THE BANNING OF THE FLIPPER ZERO! 
                    
                    </br>
                    </br>                                           
                                                                        
                        It’s no speculation that a lot of the news surrounding it lately was going to lead to its inevitable ban in the U.S. The tool is so popular in regards to what it’s being used for, that it could potentially be banned on a global scale, as it’s also in the process of being banned in places like Canada that also see it as a threat.     
                                                                    
                    </br>
                    </br> 
            
                        For those that don’t know, the Flipper Zero Tamagotchi is being used for motor vehicle car theft. The tool is so seamless and easy to use that even people that don’t understand anything about hacking could pull it off, hence its ban being set into motion. But… What if I told you it’s pointless to ban it?                                                                 
                
                    </br>
                    </br> 
                                                                
                        I want to talk about why it’s pointless to ban the Flipper Zero, as well as some basic things that could be done to prevent motor vehicle car theft with it, as well as other methods similar to it. 
                    
                    </br>
                    </br> 
        
                        I also want to talk about how Cyber Security is a game of chess, and how it is meant to be played to deter Cyber threats.

                        Today, I wanna go over an important topic about how NOT to get into Cyber Security. Today is the opposite day, so do the OPPOSITE of what I say!

                        This article idea was inspired from none other than Ricki Burke, founder at CyberSec People

                        One of the most common and most illogical misconceptions about trying to break into Cybersecurity I’ve seen is the notion that you don’t have to be technical in order to pursue this field, on top of many other things that I’m going to discuss in this article today.

                    </br>
        
                        I want you to be mindful, NONE OF THIS IS GATEKEEPING. You need to hear the TRUTH in order to pursue Cyber Security.

                    Today I’m going to talk about a topic that often comes up quite a lot for those looking to break into Cyber Security, which is how to find a mentor. A lot of people, despite all the free learning and resources available, often seek a mentor, someone who guides them throughout their journey. I’m going to talk a bit about the importance of a mentor and how they play a pivotal role in your career, as well as the MAJOR benefits of having one.                     
                
                </br>
                </br>                                                                   
                                                                    
                    I’m also going to dive into a sensitive topic as to why it’s hard to find a mentor, as well as the general etiquette and relationship dynamic between mentor and mentee. This is to help show you the do’s and don’ts when looking for one, as well as how to maintain one should you happen to find one. Mentors, GOOD ones, are HARD to find, so if you happen to land one, MAINTAIN IT! 
                                                                
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    I’m also going to address the BIG dangers of free learning and why it doesn't work for everyone. This will better establish the main reason why people still seek mentorship even though they can learn for FREE at NO COST on their own.

                    Today, I’m going to go over a fun topic, one that is surprisingly not well talked about enough that quite frankly should be. 
    
                </br>
                </br>                                                                   
                                                                    
                    I’m going to go over the various types of hackers, or “hats” to be more specific. There are seven types: white, black, gray, green, blue, red, and purple. Each hat has an agenda and purpose and plays a HUGE role in protecting our digital landscape.                                                             
                
                </br>
                </br> 
        
                    I'm also going to go over what a script kiddie is since there is A HUGE difference between them and one particular hat that is apart of the main category that is going to be discussed today. 
                                                            
                </br>
                </br> 
                                                            
                    You’ll also get more in depth as to why my head line says I am a “Gray Hat Hacker”. A lot of people, and I’ve talked with a few, have no idea what the hat’s actually stand for and why we use them. 
                                                            
                </br>
                </br> 
    
                    It’s important, especially if you are going to be a part of hacker culture. It will come up in topics, so it’s best you know what they all stand for.

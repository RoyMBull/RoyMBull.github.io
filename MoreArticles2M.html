                     <h4 id = "origin" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Women were the first programmers and invented the first computing system 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>The first programmer, and the first to develop the first computing system EVER, was by a woman named “Ada Lovelace'' who invented the “analytical” engine that theorized the main concept of numbers, “ones and zeroes” could be used for computing technology purposes other than just a mere “calculator”. Revolutionary, as it plays a vital role in how a computing system works on a binary level, using either a compiler or interpreter on behalf of a human readable programming language, to convert human readable instructions into code that a machine can understand. </p>

                        </h4>
                       
						<p>Yes, you heard that right ladies and gentlemen, the first modern human readable programming language that involved converting human words into machine code was made by a woman, specifically, “Grace Hopper”. She personally taught MEN and WOMEN how to use the language, which revolutionized the accessibility of programming. No more punch card systems. Without her we wouldn’t even have modern programming syntax that is mostly based on C.</p>

						<p>Women were the first full time paid computer programmers, and were in charge of the ENIAC systems that relied on the punch card system. These systems were also responsible for bringing us to space via NASA’s Apollo Project in 1969.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>The sad tale to this is women were considered to be just “refrigerator ladies” even though they played a major role in the advancement of computer technology which brought us to space. </p>

                        </h4>

                        <p>Yup, you heard that right! WOMEN TOOK US TO SPACE!  A woman named “Margaret Hamilton” invented the “Apollo Code” in 1969, which took us to space for the very first time!  I LOVE THIS WOMAN SO MUCH I JUST WANT TO SHAKE HER HAND AND GET HER AUTOGRAPH. You think she’d sign my laptop? NO…. MY CODE… SIGN MY CODE!!!! SIGN IT (remembers that  this is an article and I’ve started  nerding out).</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I look up to this woman all the time and bring her up when I meet women that feel less encouraged to pursue technology.</p>

                        <p>A woman named “Hedy Lamarr”, was the sole inventor and pioneer of wireless technologies: WiFi, Bluetooth, as well as modern GPS systems and the security implementation behind them. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This also influences any and all modern technical standards like IEEE which ensure the overall standard and security set in place for modern day wireless technologies. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Without her we wouldn’t have cool wireless cards that hackers use to crack and pen-test against wireless standards and test their security.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>We would also not have any form of satellite systems, microwave communication pipelines, GMS systems for cellular communication, etc, if she had not pioneered wireless technologies that are heavily implemented today. She plays one of the biggest roles in tech alongside “Margaret Hamilton” and “Ada Lovelace”.</p>

                        </h4>

						<p>Programming allows for Cyber Security to be more accessible, reducing the threshold of technical skills that are needed to enter Cyber Security.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>What do I mean by this? Well for starters, any and all tools, whether it be for offense or defense, have already been built from the ground up for you by skilled PROGRAMMERS. This means that stuff like: splunk, SOAR, SIEM, NMAP, Metasploit, etc, stuff that makes your job a lot easier, and automated,  rely on very skilled programmers to develop them. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This also applies to large scale security systems and vendors set in place that allow infrastructures to easily install and set up security systems seamlessly. This allows businesses that might not have the best knowledge and skill set for required security compliance to meet any and all needs to have a secure infrastructure. Take programming away and we loose all of that.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>If programming were to become extinct, then the new usage of tools to fight Cyber Security threats becomes null and void. You’d have to build them from the ground up which would require EVERYONE to know programming. The only reason it’s becoming less required is because there already exist teams that focus on that for you, like Security Engineers for example.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>What is a Security Engineer? Well, as the name would suggest, they help design and implement various security measures within software and system infrastructures. They also implement secure coding practices in order to patch any and all vulnerabilities that might exist in software, as well as implement new measures for ongoing projects. They play a CRUCIAL role in the overall landscape of security threats. </p>

                        </h4>

						<p>If you take away programming from Cyber Security, then  who is supposed to patch and implement version control and new security fixes each time there is a major breach? I’m waiting………??? HELLOOOO????</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This makes sense as the overall process for FDE is to enumerate THE ENTIRE file system ENTIRELY and encrypt EVERY single file on the system. Asymmetric would be too slow for this as it's a slower encryption standard. It's also commonly used in mobile device data encryption as well for the same reasons.</p>

                        </h4>

						<p>I think one of the biggest advantages to being able to program is that you can design your own custom tools. All the stuff I’ve shown you so far from previous articles are all custom made by me. I have fine tune control of what I need my tools to do. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Programming your own tools also allows you to bypass security systems  via obfuscation and evolve them if you are on the more offensive side of things. </p>

                        </h4>

						<p>Programming teaches you how to think more logically and TRULY understand what goes on under the hood behind the tools that you use on a regular basis, making you more effective with them. There’s a difference between using a port scanner, and understanding what a port scanner is. Most know how to use the tool, but many don’t understand it. Another analogy for this is people that know how to use a computer but have ZERO technical skills with one. Does it make sense?</p>

						<p>Typically this is done using something that is known as “WiFi Pineapple” from Hack5. The tool is designed to masquerade as a legitimate network access point and trick end users into connecting, posing as the router and intercepting any and all exit node traffic data that is sent to it, stripping it in the process to bypass secure communication methods. It interconnects with the main access point in the process and forwards the communication on its behalf to your target destination as if nothing ever happened. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>But, WE'RE much better than that. You shouldn't have to rely on someone else’s tool to get the job done. Are you a hacker or aren't you? I'm going to show you HOW to perform the exploit without one and the raw natural science behind it. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>HOWEVER, since this involves WIFI hacking and network penetration testing, I recommend you check out my previous article that covers more on this topic as it goes over a lot of terminology that you might be unfamiliar with. </p>

                        </h4>

						<p>Rogue access points are wireless access points that masquerade as an original access point in order to trick end users into connecting to them, or as access points that one would assume is safe to access. Once the victim connects it, simulates that of a REAL network, gateway portal and all (the login page you see when you connect to free WiFi). Once the end user is on the network they will start to use it and try to access websites that they would typically use, some requiring them to login and send over sensitive credentials. This also includes any and all forms of MFA data that is sent over as well, allowing hackers to bypass their security. What happens next involves a process known as DNS poisoning.</p>

                    </br></br>    
                    <h4 id = "dns" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is DNS Poisoning? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>DNS Poisoning is similar to a technique known as ARP poisoning, where you poison the ARP cache of a network or switch gateway device in order to receives copies of what other systems on the network are sending to and from the network. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>To put it simply with a example that is easy to understand, you’re spoofing the end user MAC/IP addresses on the network OR, directly targeting the ARP cache of the gateway device to intercept their traffic, which in return will lead to you also receiving a copy of what the target system receives as they send data over the network. This will lead to you being able to capture stuff like sensitive credentials, even bypassing secure communications like HTTPS since you can’t spy on that through normal means using stuff like wireshark or TCPdump. If you try to do so you will get nothing. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>HOWEVER, in this case we are spoofing and manipulating the DNS routing that is set in place in order to redirect the end user to malicious sites of our choosing. DNS occurs on port 53 and is what the default gateway uses in order to handle and route network traffic on your behalf while browsing the internet. This is handy in case you happen to misspell something when entering in a site name. It also handles stuff like converting name based IP addresses back to their respective numeral format so that you can browse the internet with ease. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>What we are going to do in this case, for demonstration purposes, is setup a rogue access point that will have a system on the network “acting” like the default gateway. Once the end user connects to it, we are going to have them routed to it, and then spoof sites like google via the host configuration file to route the end user on our behalf to the apache server that will contain a spoofed server usingHTTPRACKwhen they try to visit it. The goal of the attack is to have it log down any sensitive credentials that are sent from the client, which we will check via the apache logs via the configuration file located here/var/log/apache2/access.log</p>

                        </h4>

						<p>Here’s where you’re wrong about that and how you can still get hacked. Remember the last article where I talked about how the whole process of breaching a wireless access point involved sending de-authentication packets? We do this in order to bounce systems off the network and force them to re-authenticate in order to secure the 4 way handshakes for WPA2 wireless encryption. This can also be applied here to kick you off your own network and pop you onto the rogue one. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>When you connect to an access point in general your system looks for the SSID to connect to in name based format. If an attacker creates one of the same name and then kicks everyone else off the main one, who do you think it will prioritize? This can also be done via Jamming methods, combining the de-authentication method I’ve just discussed so far. It's because of this that Evil Twin attackers are able to bypass randomized AP channel security that is often seen on AP devices.</p>

</br></br>
                    <h4 id = "jamming" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What are Jamming Attacks? 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Jamming attacks jam the signal of the original access point so that victims on the network can only connect to yours when they attempt to re-authenticate back to the main AP. It causes a form of RF interference that prevents the main AP from allowing end users to connect back to it. Think of this like a form of DOS, where you block the router, in this case, so that only your AP can be interacted with if that makes sense.</p>
    
                        <p></p>

                        <p>This process is done exploiting something that is known as a “Transmit Power Level” (PWR) that is set in order to change the overall quality of the RF frequency that emits electromagnetic signals that transmit wireless data from one end point to another via a data channel line. It has an integer value, where the lower the number the better the quality. Find one that is of better quality or a match and you'll be able to jam the AP if yours is better. </p>

                        </h4>

						<p>One of the biggest dead giveaways to knowing that you are on a rogue access point is the classic lack of HTTP for sites that typically have them. If you ever notice that your network traffic doesn’t appear to be “secure” for sites that typically have HTTPS and such for them then you know that you are on one. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Be mindful just because a site has “HTTPS” doesn't mean it’s secure either if you were browsing from a legitimate access point. These are just key things to look out for if you are in these particular situations. </p>

                        </h4>

						<p>Before we dive into what Ransomware is, let's go over what FDE is, since it heavily applies to the topic for today.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>FDE, full disk encryption, is a defensive technique that is used to harden data protection across all hierarchical flat file systems. It's the overall process of enumerating the entire file system, and then applying what is known as symmetric cryptography in order to encrypt the entire data storage medium. A good example of this would be bitlocker, which is commonly used for Windows system infrastructures.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>As you know, data encryption is irreversible without the crypto keys, so by performing this method and leaving the keys out the hands of the attacker, should they breach the system, whether it be digitally or physically, any and all data they steal will be useless to them.</p>

                        </h4>

						<p>It’s quite simple, there are only a finite number of channels that we can send de-authenticate packets to, so if we wanted to, hypothetically, we can also randomize using the Aircrack-ng tool via a bash script that will randomize our channels as well so that we will eventually hit the AP. All we need is ONE of them to connect and the exploit will be successful. </p>

						<p>For this exploit, all you are going to need are two access points with different qualities in PA levels, one weaker than the other in order to kick the end user off the network. You can use whatever you want, BUT, in case you want a easy setup I recommend this product right here.

                        <p>This little toy here, the SanDisk Wireless Flash drive is one of the best “unintended” hacking tools that you could possibly own. WHY? Well, it’s a wireless access point you can connect to and share files over and save stuff too. You can practice network penetration testing on the go with this and do whatever you want. The default gateway also has all HTTP methods allowed so you can practice hacking them, that, and it also allows you to daisy chain to a main AP just like the WiFi pineapple.  It also happens to have a weaker PA level that we can exploit. That, and unlike most AP’s today, you can practice WIFI hacking against it since it doesn't have randomized channels for security. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p></p>
                        
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    
                        <p>Now, the exploit:</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>🎃 First, set the SSID of the SanDisk AP to anyone that you desire. You can do this for the gateway portal where all the configurations are located.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>🎃 Next, add systems to the network and then have them connect to the target AP gateway portal of the system to check if you are on the right network. If they can talk to the portal then you are good to go. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>🎃 Next, pop open a router that you have and change its SSID to that of the SanDisk one, and then, and this is also CRUCIAL, set the password for the Access point to NONE. You need to do this so that the end users are automatically authenticated to the AP. This creates the illusion they are re-authenticating, allowing you to go undetected. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>🎃 Next, pop open my video  that I’ve provided and follow along up until “2:50”, which is where you will see the main AP of the Sandisk Flash drive being de-athenticated. This also shows you how to setup the NIC to sniff AP's Follow those very steps to kick end users off the network, and watch as they bounce to the rogue one that you’ve created. Once that’s done check if you have clients on the rogue network. If they are, then the exploit was a success!</p>

                        </h4>

						<p>Meterpreter shell is a form of payload in the metasploit suite that allows an attacker to create a seamless backdoor. Each one tailors to a particular OS archetype and can be delivered in various ways. It also houses various custom command that allow you to: keylog a system, screen watch live, tap into camera feeds, etc.

                        </h4>

						<p>MsfVenom is a tool apart of the metasploit site that is used to convert any and all payloads into an executable for any desired format that is needed. It also comes with encoding methods to obfuscate the payload so that it can avoid security systems that might recognize the signature of the payload.

						<p>It’s no speculation that a lot of the news surrounding it lately was going to lead to its inevitable ban in the U.S. The tool is so popular in regards to what it’s being used for, that it could potentially be banned on a global scale, as it’s also in the process of being banned in places like Canada that also see it as a threat.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>For those that don’t know, the Flipper Zero Tamagotchi is being used for motor vehicle car theft. The tool is so seamless and easy to use that even people that don’t understand anything about hacking could pull it off, hence its ban being set into motion. But… What if I told you it’s pointless to ban it? </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I want to talk about why it’s pointless to ban the Flipper Zero, as well as some basic things that could be done to prevent motor vehicle car theft with it, as well as other methods similar to it.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I also want to talk about how Cyber Security is a game of chess, and how it is meant to be played to deter Cyber threats. </p>

                        <h4 id = "flipperzero" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">What is the Flipper Zero?  🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>The Flipper Zero Tamagotchi is a multi functioning tool that is able to intercept, clone, and replay various data communication methods specifically tailored to Radio/RF and RFID/NFC. This allows it to clone any form of authentication credentials that might pertain to the end user, allowing a threat actor to bypass security and access the system.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>In simpler terms, it’s able to clone the unique signature and data that is exchanged via remote control, such as a automobile car remote that unlocks the car door for you, or via RFID/NFC device tap, which exchanges data when you tap things like your ID badge to access a control room for example. It can even be simpler things like the NFC chips that are installed on our debit/credit cards, or our phones when we “tap” it to make purchases on a regular basis or access various facilities like storage units. An attacker could use this to: break into your car, purchase things on your behalf, access control systems and authenticate as if they were you, and a lot more. The list goes on!</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This technique is also what is known as a Replay Attack, which is commonly used to intercept crypto keys in order to perform a Wrapping Attack that allows an attacker to man in the middle and change the overall contents of the data that is being exchanged as if they were the original sender, while using the key to peek and do so each time.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>If you ban the Flipper Zero then you have to ban every hacking tool that exists</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>There are a ton of hacking tools on the market, even ones from <a href = "https://shop.hak5.org/" style = "text-decoration: none;">Hack5</a> that also can do what the Flipper Zero does. To ban the Flipper Zero, means to ban all these tools as well. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Take For example the HackRF One which can also analyze RF frequencies for various purposes like the Flipper Zero and imitate them. It’s been around long before the Flipper Zero was ever made and it has yet to be banned. The only difference between the two, is that one is more accessible than the other. If that’s the case, then we need to upgrade our security so silly stuff like this DOESN’T happen. Rule of thumb, IF A SCRIPT KIDDIE CAN PWN IT, IT’S A PROBLEM!</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Besides, it’s easy to make your own Flipper Zero if you're skilled enough to do so. You can even name it whatever you want and bypass the ban. The Flipper Zero isn’t anything we haven’t seen before, it’s just cute and popular!</p>

                        </br></br>
                        <h4 id = "lackofsecurity" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">It’s not the Flipper Zero, It’s our lack of Security 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>The problem isn't the Flipper Zero, it’s our lack of proper understanding of security practices that can be used to effectively neutralize the threat.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>It’s no shocker that the implementation of Cyber Security practices are just now becoming a standard, with legal aspects cracking down HARD and punishing infrastructures for not implementing it, via fines and other means. This is because we are moving closer and closer to a more digital landscape where everything is connected, which is good news for hackers, since it extends the scope and range of what they can target now more than ever.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Security has been one of the many things ignored for far too long. It’s the main reason why we have so many security breaches. Most systems, even basic stuff like web applications, don’t factor security in terms of overall design. It’s our job to ensure that anything and everything is properly secured regardless of what format said technology comes from. This also includes automobiles, which is the main topic for today since it relates to the Flipper Zero Tamagotchi.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>The problem now is that we are just now catching up, while hackers have already done their homework and pretty much can stay ahead of the game. We need to do the same!</p>

<h4 id = "chess" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Cyber Security Is A Game of Chess 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>Cyber Security is a game of chess. What do I mean by that? I think the best example would be the classic one I provide a lot in my articles, my CTF server, <a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Futabas_Playground" style = "text-decoration: none;">“Futaba’s Playground”</a>.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>When I made the CTF server I basically had to “play this game of chess”, where I had to think several steps ahead of the player as they progressed throughout the game as if they were a “real” adversary. I had to think of all the possible variables of what the player could do to bypass my security and cheat the game.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>For example, I ran into an issue where the player could easily access critical files on the server that would allow them to capture flags in unintended ways. This could easily be done via the browser, as well as ssh shells which are intended for the player to progress. This is a HUGE no go, so I needed to put a stop to that pronto. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>My thought process to upgrade security was to figure out how to block easy web application access to the files, while also blocking ssh system command access to the files, and on top of this, I needed to make sure the server account hosting the web application could still read the files, while also ensuring the player could progress. Still with me? I know, this was a major headache for me too and took a lot of trial and error until I got it right!</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>The remedy for this was to: set the files on the server to ownership of the main account that reads it, that way only it and root users can access it. Root access can only be done on the final stage of the game, so by the time the player manages to get to all the files it will already be too late. See what I did there? I did a lot more, but of course, NO SPOILERS!</p>

                 <h4 id = "prevent" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">How to prevent automobile theft via the Flipper Zero (IN THEORY) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>In theory, and it’s quite simple, the best way to prevent automobile theft with the Flipper Zero is to implement the same methods that prevent Replay Attacks in general: splitting the data channels so that authenticated credentials to unlock the motor vehicle are not sent alongside each other. You can even layer frequency randomization on top of that much like with wireless access points to throw the tool off, that way it misses its target. These little things can hurt the effectiveness of the tool greatly.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I don’t specialize in motor vehicle security, but I’m pretty sure there are a ton of other methods that can prevent the Flipper Zero from hacking into car systems. We just need to implement the security in place to do so!</p>

                        <p></p>

                        </h4>

						<p>There is a common misconception going around lately that you don’t need to be technical to be in Cyber Security, a lot of which comes from faulty marketing schemes and training programs that prey on those that desperately wish to enter the field, selling them this false mindset that they can learn Cyber and land a job in a matter of 24 weeks with no technical background or formal training: IT, networking, programming, etc, all in order to make a profit.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This is highly unethical and NOT true, and sets people up for failure in the long run, which leads to a lot of missing talent that is needed in Cyber Security right now. This also leads to a lot of people taking a lot of shortcuts that set them back in the long run, making them underprepared to enter the field. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Regardless of what side you are on: red team, blue team, purple team, or the type of technology you help secure, you NEED to have a deep understanding of it if you truly wish to secure it. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>If you are a red teamer, you need to understand how various core technologies work in order to exploit them. This allows you to find critical flaws in the system you are testing against so it can be properly secured. How can you exploit something when you don’t understand how it works? Yes there are tons of tools, SQLmap for example, that can help red teamers pinpoint SQL injection vulnerabilities, but you still need to understand how SQL injection works on a fundamental level to use it properly. The tool is only as good as your fundamental understanding of the vulnerability it was designed to exploit. Not understanding how to find this type of vulnerability, even with the tool could cause you to miss critical vulnerabilities that did in fact exist, which can cause A LOT OF real world damage to an infrastructure if left unchecked.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>If you are a blue teamer, you need to understand how core technologies work on a fundamental level so you can properly secure them. How can you secure something when you don’t understand how it works? Take the CTF server I made for example, <a href = "https://github.com/RoyMBull/Futabas_Playground" style = "text-decoration: none;">"Futaba's Playground"</a>. It requires me to understand proper secure coding principles, as well as Linux system administration and configurations in order to properly secure the server. This prevents the player from bypassing any security for any and all challenges in unintended ways. I secured the server as if it were a real system from real threats, YOU, the player. If I wanted to take it a step further I can combine it with already pre-made tools and frameworks like SIEM and SOAR for example, that upgrade and smoothen the process for me depending on what I need it for. See where I’m going with this? </p>

                    </h4>

					<p>I wrote an article a while back on why programming is crucial for Cyber Security. You can check that out <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-programming-import-cyber-security-roy-bull-futaba-webs--sm80e/?trackingId=1l%2BRV%2FzwQUatieczffa%2Fig%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BVEzx1nN%2FR3S024KklIANNg%3D%3D" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a> if you would like to. For now, I’m going to talk a bit about forensics, one of the main fields in Cyber that people want to get into but REFUSE to learn how to code for. A lot of this is due to what I mentioned earlier, about people being sold the false notion they don’t need to be technical to work in Cyber. You do need to be technical if you want to get into forensics. Forensics is crucial in that it stops the spread of malware should it pose a real worldwide threat. </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p>Forensics, most of which involves a lot of reverse engineering and malware analysis, does in fact require you to know how to code, as well as be able to read it regardless of what programming language it might be in. Does it require you to understand how to program in every language and framework under the sun? No! But you do need to understand how code works, as  well as the technology behind it under the hood. This also requires in depth technical knowledge about stuff like a debugger which allows you to trace binary code flow. </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p>You need to understand how to write code so that you can replicate and/ or tamper with strains of malware you find. This allows you to cross test and find mitigations to secure against future malware infections. </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p>You need to understand how to read code, regardless of whether or not it might be a language you’re familiar with in order to dissect it. Sure, stick to malware in languages that you are familiar with, but often in the realm of Cyber Security, hackers are creative, and you’ll often find unicorn-like malware or techniques that you didn’t know about. You need to be able to adapt, and interpret it. Reading code is hard due to the nature of how sloppy and undocumented most code is written. You need to get comfortable with that and understand how to read and follow along core programming logic to understand how malware works. </p>

                </h4>


                <p>BUILD YOUR BRAND! BUILD YOUR BRAAANNND! I Can’t stress this enough. The market for Cyber Security is HIGHLY competitive right now. You need to stand out. Even if you are a skilled professional, people need to know who you are. Remember, it’s not about what you know (even though it is in Cyber), it’s about WHO, you know. Even if you are a skilled professional, if no one is able to see what you can do, and it’s not interactive then NOBODY CARES!!! Get used to that. Would you hire the nobody, or the somebody that has shown what they can do? Remember, this is a HIGH paying COMPETITIVE field, where places are looking to hire the best of the best. They are investing in YOU, to secure their systems, so don’t disappoint! There are tons of skilled people, but not many that show off what they can do, and lose out to many that are unqualified due to poor marketing. All brain and no aim. </p>

                <p></p>

                <p>Take for example, my brand <a href = "https://linktr.ee/Futaba_Webs" style = "text-decoration: none;">Futaba_Webs</a>. I’ve been in the dark for a while now about my skill sets and was just mindlessly applying to jobs and hoping for the best. I wasn’t networking or marketing myself so that professionals could engage with me and see my skill sets. This HURT me a lot, especially as someone that is self taught and cannot easily afford certifications. I have a lot of skill, most of which is “abnormal” from the level I should be at professionally in case you haven’t noticed. Despite what my resume says, I’ve been in tech for YEARS, and in each role, if you read closely, I was ALWAYS involved in some form of Cyber Security in each one. </p>

                <p></p>

                <p>The results I got? Constant connections flooding in, my brand going in the right direction, being asked to provide MORE mentorship and when I'll be doing it with a program I plan to announce soon <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/Futaba_Webs" style = "text-decoration: none;">here</a>, as well as being on the radar of high ranking and high level well established Cyber Security professionals. The results have been insane, and the support that has followed with it has been amazing as well. I’ve also been tagged in regards to large scale conferences and asked to speak at them, one I plan to do soon. </p>

                <p></p>

                <p>Even all of my articles and tutorials have been clever strategies to help advertise and sell my brand and get people to support my work so that they feel comfortable supporting my product I plan to launch soon which people have been asking for more of. People want to support you and aid you, but you have to PROVE you are legit. GET YOUR NAME OUT THERE NOW!!!!</p>

            </h4>

			<p>If you don’t like having to constantly learn and adapt, then maybe this isn’t the field for you. In case you haven’t noticed, Cyber Security is an ever evolving landscape, where threats are constantly evolving. You need to stay in the loop on new technologies and methods hackers use to breach systems. This information alone allows us to improve our overall security infrastructures and keep them safe. Refusing to adapt is like refusing to update from Windows XP to the latest firmware. You pick up what I’m putting down?

			<p>Trying to sell CyberSecurity products and spread security awareness? Part of the reason no one takes their security practices seriously is due to the lack of understanding of it, and how it’s explained. Notice how ALL of my articles I go into FULL detail and break technical concepts down to their simplest form, with examples that are easy to understand while still retaining their core technical aspects. Notice how this entire article I’ve essentially done the same thing, while still being technical but not TOO technical. You understand? Good! </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>You need to be mindful that not everyone is technical and some people need it to be explained to them in simpler terms. COMMUNICATION IS KEY!</p>

						<p>I’m also going to dive into a sensitive topic as to why it’s hard to find a mentor, as well as the general etiquette and relationship dynamic between mentor and mentee. This is to help show you the do’s and don’ts when looking for one, as well as how to maintain one should you happen to find one. Mentors, GOOD ones, are HARD to find, so if you happen to land one, MAINTAIN IT! </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I’m also going to address the BIG dangers of free learning and why it doesn't work for everyone. This will better establish the main reason why people still seek mentorship even though they can learn for FREE at NO COST on their own.</p>

                        </h4>

						<p>Cyber Security mentors are the people with experience that lead and guide the next wave of people that are seeking to enter the field. They are your teachers, and like all teachers, are CRUCIAL in order to build up your repertoire of knowledge needed to succeed in your field. They help guide you through all the stuff you need to know and filter out the stuff you don’t need to know. They also help you figure out your main interest, and narrow the skill sets you need to learn in order to succeed. They also help you develop the proper critical thinking skills that are needed to succeed in your field as well. </p>

        <h4 id = "part1" style = "text-align: center; color: #D43F52;">Why is finding a mentor so hard? (Part 1) 🕸🕸🎃🕸🕸

                        </h4>

						<p>One of the biggest reasons why it’s hard to find a mentor is due to the shady intentions that come from most people in the Cyber Security field. It’s not news by now that a lot of people in Cyber are just looking to sell you false hopes and dreams, empty promises that are just a mere cash grab. LEARN CYBER SECURITY IN 24 WEEKS AND MASTER— You pick up what I’m putting down right?</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Not everyone has the best intentions for you, and some, quite frankly… even those that have been in the field for years with a shiny title… Don’t know their stuff and THEY are the ones that are holding the high level certs and positions.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>You need to also be mindful, THERE IS A LOT OF GATEKEEPING in this field. People are willing to lead others down the wrong path if it means they keep you out and or get in. If you’re looking for a mentor, make sure you check their credibility and look into them before you check in for services with them. I recommend looking for mentors that are SHOWING you what they know vs ones that HIDE all of their stuff. YouTube content creators like Rana Khali, who now runs her own academy is a classic example of someone that has established solid credibility and trust that you can look into if you need mentorship. </p>

                        </h4>

						<p>Much like how not all mentors have the best of intentions, the same can also be said for mentees. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Mentees, for those that do not know, have been known to take advantage of their mentors, especially the free ones who are commonly sought after. A lot of this is due to a sense of entitlement and them using any means to get in, even if they have to exploit their fellow learners and mentors in the process. Not everyone is looking to win with you so you need to be mindful of that!</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>A lot of people, and I’m sorry to even have to say this, belittle mentors, specifically ones that help for free. Some even ghost their mentors after they help them land a job. It’s these very critical reasons why free mentors are stepping away, most charging you now for their time. People don't want to be taken advantage of. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This also explains the main reason why people aren’t very “friendly” when you DM them and ask them for tips and tricks, and why if you do get a “free” answer, it's rather vague.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>For me personally, it is the main reason why I have rejected EVERY SINGLE person that has asked for free mentorship thus far. All it takes is for ONE bad cookie, and it has a rippling effect. </p>

                        </h4>

						<p>Most people sadly aren’t mentorable. More times than none, as someone that mentors consistently, PEOPLE DO NOT LISTEN TO THEIR MENTORS! If you are going to seek mentorship LISTEN TO THE PROFESSIONALS advice, especially if it comes from one that is highly credible.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>People are looking for shortcuts to get in, and when they find out there aren’t any, and they have to do and learn the thing, they bail out and stop listening to their mentor, thinking they are trying to mislead them. THEY AREN’T, AND YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO THEM, otherwise you are just setting yourself back, and wasting everyone’s valuable time!</p>

                        </h4>

						<p>Mentors are NOT recruiters. It’s not their job to land you a role, that’s YOUR job, as well as the job of a recruiter. </p>

                        <p></p>


                        <p>People often leave their mentorships due to not securing a role, because they have the impression that their mentor is responsible for that. They don’t owe you that nor should you expect that from them, especially if they are trying to help you for free. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>They are there to guide/teach you how Cyber Security works so that you build up the skill sets needed to succeed in this field. It’s YOUR job to decide what you do with that knowledge. No one is responsible for your success but you!</p>

						<p>Keep in touch with your mentor! It’s CRUCIAL! As I’ve mentioned before, there is a lot of ghosting going around lately towards mentors that put in a lot of time to help their mentees, especially ones that do so for FREE. Respect their time and keep in touch!</p>

						<p>I cannot stress this enough, and this also applies to the real world in general, NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR PERSONAL PROBLEMS. Don’t take your personal issues out on your mentor. They are here to help you! It’s your job to stay in touch and give that bit of communication in case something does happen so they can understand. People can’t understand you if you don’t communicate! </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>RESPECT YOUR MENTORS!</p>

						<p>A lot of people think that the thing they want is FREE learning, but it’s not, it’s free mentorship and guidance which no one owes you! </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Teaching yourself anything from the ground up is possible, but it’s EXTREMELY HARD! There is no one to guide you or explain the stuff you need to know. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I’ve been self taught for about 11 years now and I reassure you, figuring out where I had to go for Cyber was hard. I was running around in circles trying to figure stuff out. I wasn’t able to find a Cyber mentor due to all the things that I’ve mentioned, which is why I put so much effort into it. PEOPLE NEED MENTORS!</p>

						<p>I’m going to go over the various types of hackers, or “hats” to be more specific. There are seven types: white, black, gray, green, blue, red, and purple. Each hat has an agenda and purpose and plays a HUGE role in protecting our digital landscape.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>I'm also going to go over what a script kiddie is since there is A HUGE difference between them and one particular hat that is apart of the main category that is going to be discussed today.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>You’ll also get more in depth as to why my head line says I am a “Gray Hat Hacker”. A lot of people, and I’ve talked with a few, have no idea what the hat’s actually stand for and why we use them. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>It’s important, especially if you are going to be a part of hacker culture. It will come up in topics, so it’s best you know what they all stand for. </p>

                        </h4>

						<p>White hat hackers are basically the good guys, the Cyber Security professionals that help defend various system and business infrastructures, as well as being responsible for the very security that is implemented in them as well. Without them, there would be no form of security in any and all forms of technology, and we would all be exposed to various threats. This is why “Cyber Security” exists. If you are in Cyber Security, then by default you are a white hat hacker, unless you identify otherwise. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>They are also penetration testers that focus on exploiting a system in order to find vulnerabilities in a system, reporting it so that the side that defends can mitigate the threat so that real threat actors are unable to take advantage of it. This is typically done in the fashion of finding the flaw in the system before someone else does. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This hat is split into 2 unique categories, that I’m pretty sure you might already be familiar with, red team and blue team. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Red teamers, are the offensive security professionals like penetration testers for example who attack to find weaknesses in the system, and report them. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Blue teamers, are the defenders, who specialize in the core implementation of security remedies that help protect system infrastructures, as well as being first responders to various security breaches that occur within business infrastructures. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Each team has their own set of specialties and roles that dive deeper into the matter of what they do, but I'll leave that for another article explaining the both of them, so you can get a better idea of where you might want to start out in Cyber Security. </p>

						<p>These are the bad guys, legit threat actors that seek to exploit a system for personal game: money, data, fame, etc. Unlike white hat hackers who have major restrictions and limitations on what they can and can’t do when conducting an official penetration test, black hat hackers don’t have this restraint. They exploit systems in any and all various ways, which is why we have to keep evolving our mitigation tactics in order to neutralize cyber crime. They are the main reason we are in an ever ending fight to protect the digital landscape. </p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>They also tend to operate on places like the dark web, providing illegal services from various means based on their skill set. </p>

						<p>A common trick that a lot of people like to use in order to prevent unauthorized network breaches, is they like to hide their SSID’s which is the name of the network. This is effective in that you can hide SSID information from common means of exposure, like the GUI you use when selecting a wireless access point to communicate with.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>The problem with this is it can easily be bypassed by the same method mentioned in option #2 of how to bypass MAC address filtering. </p>

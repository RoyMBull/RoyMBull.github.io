                    This is the final tier for all of my regular patreon content that isn't apart of my mentorship tiers. THERE ARE NO LIMITED SPOTS FOR THIS! It's heavily focused on Cyber Security content and is where my main follower should subscribe if they wish to gain access to highly exclusive content. This will be one of the main tiers I invest a lot of benefits into.                    
                </br>
            </br>
                    * You get 2 day early access to any and all non-excluisve updates before they are announced on all of my platforms!
                </br>
            </br>

                    * Members of this tier will receive a more advanced version of any and all articles that are released. This means that you get access to exclusive stuff like: exploit guides, videos, including any programming videos if they are set for it that non-patreons won't get.
                </br>
            </br>

                    * Members of this tier will receive 1 additional EXCLUSIVE article on top of the 2 that are set to launch bi-weekly, which will sample some of the main material that will be in my mentorship program when it launches. That way you get to see if you would like the content for it BEFORE you buy it! This includes any and all exploit videos and guides that happen to come with it!

                Futaba’s Playground: This is a custom portable CTF server that I wrote in: HTML/CSS/JS, and PHP. The server is designed to allow you to pentest wherever you are locally vs the traditional means of having to be connected to the internet in order to engage in web application pentesting CTF challenges, allowing you to get practice wherever you are on the go.

                </br>
                Python Tools: These are my CUSTOM penetration testing tools I’ve developed with Python3, all safe for testing, as well a stuff like: MITB exploits where I can pop dummy browsers and phish the end user, Crypto Malware safe for demonstration (run at your own risk), and even stuff like custom backdoor exploits and a lot more!

                        Check out some of my latest Articles and Exploit guides here, and other Premium content! 
                        I write monthly issues for my Patreon which are devised into the following: News Articles to keep you informed on the latest Cyber Security News, Exploit guides where I show you PRACTICAL applications for Ethical Hacking and Offensive Security, Software Engineering content where I provide Ethical guides on how to apply Programming to Cyber and various tool development, and additional stuff like: Forensics, Malware analysis, and even secure coding demonstrations.
                                             
                    </br>
                </br>

                        Danger Series: This is a news article series I’ve created where I raise more Cyber Security awareness about critical flaws and vulnerabilities that exist within various system infrastructures, including any protocols and data communication methods, and the Dangers of what could happen should they be exploited to the fullest extent. I also go over various mitigation strategies that can be used to prevent them as well.

                 </br>
                </br>

                        Exploit Guides: I cover BEGINNER friendly to more ADVANCED exploitation guides that are more on the PRACTICAL side of things, meaning, you can actually apply them on a real world level outside of a lab based environment. I create all sorts of labs and walkthroughs, even demonstration videos on how to use certain tools for Offensive Security and Penetration Testing.


            </br>
        </br>

                        Software Content: This mostly revolves around overall tool development, where I show you how to apply your programming skills for Ethical Hacking and Offensive Security. You’ll learn how to write your own tools as well as learn how to get crafty with them and FULLY understand the techniques you implement on a regular basis with standardized tools today!


    </br>
</br>

                        Forensics/Mal Dev/Secure Coding: This is where I dive into one of my specialties, which is reverse engineering and malware development. I pull apart various forms of malware and then show you how to write your own version of them, as well as showing you some solid forensics techniques in the process while doing so. I also use vulnerable code and walk you through how it works on a fundamental level, and pinpoint EXACTLY what makes it vulnerable, as well as how to fix it.

                        I’m a self-taught software engineer with a background in cyber security/penetration testing, and have been programming for over 11 years now. One of my specialties is reverse engineering. I like to reverse engineer various core API’s and technologies in order to explore and fabricate new ideas that will make my projects come to life. My favorite video game series known as the MBNS(Megaman Battle Network Series) inspired me to want to learn how to code/program.

                        The name Futaba_Webs was inspired from my list of favorite video game characters that are hackers: Futaba from Persona 5, Wrench from WatchDogs 2, and Sombra from Overwatch. The other half of my name, Webs, is inspired from my love of the way of the spider, Spider-Man, my favorite spider(s) being, Spider-Gwen and Superior Spider-Man.

                        There are also keyboard shortcuts that can be used to pop you in and out of a shell, including the more advanced one which is FULLY Command Line Interface, allowing you to control the site using ONLY your keyboard.

                More is in store for this feature, as I’ll be taking what was originally intended for it and further improving it BEYOND current heights!
